Due to Reddit’s contest policy, we decided to ask our winner to choose a non-profit to highlight and share with the community in addition to a fancy new user flair.

"r/WholesomeMemes will only allow original content (OC) Hey friendos! 

The best way for us to take back our community from spam and bots is to be very selective of the content we allow here. 

Here are the main things we are looking for:

* Is it wholesome?
   * Uplifting, life-affirming, kind.
   * This is subjective at the discretion of moderators. 
* Is it a meme?
   * A meme is an image or video/gif with text included in or on the image.
   * Screenshots of social media or news are not memes.
   * OC Comics are allowed as long as they are wholesome.
* Is it original content (OC)?
   * If you did not personally make the meme, do not post it!
   * Edited comics are also allowed as long as you are the one that edited it.
   * No reposts are allowed! It doesn’t matter if it has not been posted in the community before. If you did not make it, it is considered a repost. The only exception being that you personally made a meme and did not share it in our community EVER. We only want original content.

Please be sure to read all of our rules on the sidebar. Make sure that your comments are wholesome too as we do not tolerate hatred or bigotry of any kind. If you see a post or comment that breaks our rules, please report it so mods can take action. All posts for the time being will need to be approved by a moderator, so please allow up to a 24 hours for us approve your meme or follow up with any reports. Moderators are humans too, so if we make a mistake or if you have any feedback, please send us a modmail so we can take action.

"Share Your Wholesome Moments :) Hey r/wholesomememes fam! We are continuing our weekly effort to provide a casual space where you can share personal achievements, wholesome moments, and found memes (does not need to be OC in this post). 

Check out last week’s thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/s/eTZbJk9iQP

For this week, let’s try setting goals that can reasonably be accomplished by the end of the week. If you have already achieved a goal you set recently, we would love to hear about it! 

If you have an original wholesome meme (that you made) you want to share that is uplifting and/or motivating, we encourage you to make a separate post. After we got rid of spam, bots, and reposts, moderators must approve every post. This has led our community to be far less active. So we hope these weekly posts help encourage more organic conversation and visibility for the community.

"Share your wholesome moments! Hello Friends! As we have been seeing less posts on r/WholesomeMemes after trying a few things to increase engagement, we would like to invite you to have a more casual wholesome experience through a weekly post.

That’s where you are right now! 

——

Our rules (which have been used for many years) state that memes should be general and not specific. So we limit personal things like achievements, romantic relationships, and conversations. This helps keep things uplifting and motivational.

Last year (2024) we also stopped allowing social media posts and started requiring memes to be original content (OC) to reduce spam/bot reposts. This has led to a major decline in activity on the sub. This is a fate the mods have accepted for eliminating spam. We are open to feedback and have some ideas for later this year, but for now this is what we are proposing. If the community likes it, we’ll do this every week. 

———

So here in this thread we encourage you to share your wholesome moments, memories, and personal achievements in the comments. This can be something as simple as commenting, “I showed up for myself today!”

We have also enabled the option to add images in comments so you can share wholesome memes you have found or ones you made that might be too specific or personal. (If the image feature is abused it will be removed.) if you made a meme that follows our rules, please share it as a post instead.

Please keep in mind that all our other rules apply. No links/spam. No personal info or usernames. No politics. No NSFW. And don’t forget to keep it wholesome!",excited,wholesomememes

"After extensive research and careful consideration, the r/wholesomememes mod team has made the difficult decision to end After extensive research and careful consideration, the r/wholesomememes mod team has made the difficult decision to end the use of non-whole numbers within our community. 

Starting today, only whole numbers will be permitted. If your post or comment includes a non-whole number, it will be removed and you will be required to complete the [Wholesome Math 101](https://youtu.be/o-YBDTqX_ZU) course by the end of the month. Failure to complete the course will collapse time and space, enveloping reality in endless darkness.

Please review the following numerical standards that will be implemented starting today:

✅ Whole Numbers Only! (keep it positive!)  
❌ No Fractions (they cause division)  
❌ No Decimals (too divisive, keep it whole)  
❌ No Negative Numbers (they are too pessimistic)  
❌ No Imaginary Numbers (they aren’t real and neither is the internet, go touch some grass)  
❌ No Irrational Numbers (Being irrational is not wholesome)  
❌ No Prime Numbers (they are too exclusive, and we are an inclusive community)

"I finally have the sisters I never had growing up I never had sisters growing up. Just me and my two older brothers 8 and 10 years older than me. So I basically grew up alone. They were always out with friends. My parents were always at work. I was the only girl and the only one home most of the time. It was lonely. I always longed for a sister. Someone to talk to, learn from, hang out with. I never learned how to be girly, how to do my hair or makeup, how to talk about crushes or handle friendships. 

But everything I missed out on growing up got made up for when my brothers married the two most amazing women. One of my sister in laws, Amira, is my twin in spirit. Chaotic, ADHD energy, never a dull moment when we’re together. She’s the wild, hilarious big sister I never had. And then there’s Mira calm(sometimes, she’s lowkey cracked out), wise, voice of reason sister in law who gives me exactly the role model I needed. She feels like the older sister I always wished I had, love going to her house randomly to steal her food then staying over until 2 am bothering the hell outta her and my brother, lmfao. And also just sitting and talking with them n talking about life. 

They’re both beautiful inside and out. They always welcome me with open arms. I can go to them for anything makeup advice, boy problems, family rants, life questions. My brothers are stinky little ogres but somehow they brought two of the most important people into my life.
I love them so much. I feel so lucky to have them.",excited,wholesome

I recently joined a women’s league and have been having more fun than I’ve had in years. Yesterday I was talking to my husband and asked if he was going to come to my game last night. He said he was going to stop by his mom’s for her birthday and wasn’t sure he was going to make it. I also had bad communication with all my people who live close and didn’t tell them about the game until late. Around the third inning I had a really good catch and when I looked over at the bleachers and saw my husband there, I was so freaking happy. It really felt like I whipped back in time to a place of such innocence and happiness. ",excited,wholesome

"Wrapped in Autumn’s Embrace: A Cozy Morning Dream Imagine waking up to a crisp morning wrapped in a soft cashmere scarf in deep burnt sienna and muted amber hues. The air is tinged with the scent of spiced chai and fallen leaves, a gentle mix of cinnamon, clove and sweet earthiness that feels like a warm hug.

You stroll through a quiet park where golden leaves flutter lazily from ancient oaks, painting the ground in a mosaic of honey, rust, and caramel. The sun filters through the branches with a gentle, honeyed glow.

In the distance, a small café invites you in with the aroma of fresh pumpkin bread and vanilla coffee. You settle by a window, wrapped in a chunky knit sweater the color of soft moss, sipping slowly and watching the world slow down around you.

Your favorite autumn playlist plays softly, acoustic guitar strings, mellow vocals and a hint of piano, each note echoing the perfect balance of introspection and quiet joy.

Later, wrapped in a warm wool blanket, you wander to a nearby lake. The water reflects the fiery sunset, a mix of rose gold and deep plum and you let yourself get lost in the stillness, feeling peaceful, grounded and a little enchanted.",excited,wholesome

"After half a decade of yearning, this happened I ""ran away"" in 1969 with a few choice essentials tied in a bandanna and hung on a stick. Dad even took my picture in the driveway.

"I made an elderly woman cry this week. I have the opportunity to teach at this ""class"" where elderly people learn to use newer generation phones. Haven't done this before (as I've never really worked with people above 50 years old), so naturally I was a bit anxious. The initial deal was for me to teach 1 class/week.

Over the weeks, and after a few good jokes, a bit of banter and a lot of practical examples, I've received such positive feedback that we've now extended to _four_ class a week. 

I didn't think it would get any better, until today.

One of the elderly ladies who attend the course told me about her son in the 50s. About how much she misses him, about him having a lot of citations in his field, and about him being a Professor of Bioinformatics in USA.

At that point, we were revising downloading photos from Google, so I ""tested"" her a bit. I instructed her to write her son's full name, and when she did, I asked her to go to ""Images"".

Tears began to fall on her cheeks. There was a professional photo of him, to which she said: _""I didn't even *know* about this photo._

I was like: _""This photo can be yours as a memory to cherish. Just long press it and press ""Download image"", and you'll have it in your Gallery._

She then began to thank me and showed her other ""classmates"" what she's managed to do.

I hope you all end up working with at least one person that cherishes your work. I know a lot of it can be thankless, but God help me, such an impact has an immense value.",excited,wholesome
"Panda Express made me cry The school year is coming to an end and im completely exhausted. To add to that, my kids got sick and have been passing it around. My youngest is having a hard time eating and all they wanted was Panda express noodles. It was late, I'm tired, but if it'll make her feel better then why not? 

I attempted to order on the app first. It kept saying that it couldn't be delivered to me or there was a payment issue. I was so frustrated. I didn't want to make the drive, but finally decided to suck it up and go. 

I get there and they are busy for a Sunday night. I give them my order, 5 large chow mein, a 2 item combo, and 2 large meats. The employee stopped me and told me that a family dinner would save me money and give me the same amount of chow mein. 

When the manager saw what she was doing, she stopped her and said it would be more beneficial to do a tray of chow mein and then a family meal. 

I got the whole tray, they substituted the one chow mein in the family meal for another meat, and I still got my 2 dinner combo. 

I went to pay, and not only did I get more food, but it was $30 dollars cheaper. I thanked all of them profusely. I told the manager that my kids were sick and all they wanted was the chow mein. She smiled, said she understood, and was glad she could help. 

When I got home, I realized she put two extra sides of chow mein for me and about 30 cookies. sometimes I feel so lost, like I'm drowning in parenthood, and her small act of kindness meant so much to me. I'm teary-eyed even typing this out. 

I can't remember names, but I wrote corporate to tell them how incredible that store is. I hope it helps them in some way, or it just makes their day like they made mine. 

Thank you, kind stranger. ",excited,wholesome

"I'm reading my husband bedtime stories! My husband wants to read more but hasn't been able to make time for a long time now. Recently, we decided that I could read him whatever I'm reading. But before doing that, I wanted to read him stories that were very close to my heart growing up because they were from a series of books my parents bought for me when they were expecting me. So yeah, these books are older than me and I love them. 

Anyway, this is my second night reading to my husband from these books - just getting to share a piece of my childhood I treasure deeply. And it is so satisfying to me that both times, he's fallen fast asleep and looks so peaceful and cosy.

My husband has healed wounds in me that he had no role in creating so every time I get to do something soft and warm for him makes me so happy. He's fast asleep now so I just had to get my excitement out.

"Engaged/Married couples: tell me your proposal story!! My fiancé proposed to me a couple weeks ago and I wanted to know how everybody else experienced theirs, because I love reading cute gushy stories like that. 

My fiancé and I are kind of long distance (we have to take a train across provinces to see each other) and we had originally made arrangements for him to visit me on a Saturday. He knew I had the day off prior though and arranged it privately with my mother to pick him up on the Friday instead instead to surprise me. Now surprise visits weren’t out of character for him, so I wasn’t suspicious. 

My town is kind of grungy, not very romantic, but whenever he’d visit me we had a small little spot that had a few cute flowers and small trees and park benches. We told each other we loved each other for the first time at that spot and we also exchanged love notes there. The day he proposed, the spot happened to be on the way to where we were walking to for lunch. He said he had a card for me. 

He propped up the phone to record me reading the card, so I was a bit suspicious by then but I brushed it off. When he gave me the card, it was a poem inside. The last line of the card read: “You quickly made me fall, But on my left knee…”
That’s when he got down with the ring and said “DumzaDay will you marry me?”

It was perfect. I’m a simple gal, and this simple yet romantic proposal literally made me cry in his arms so much I almost forgot to answer him haha. It happened in my hometown, not around too many people so there wasn’t any pressure of other people's eyes on me, not overly extravagant, and it was a personal spot. It was perfect.  

I’m curious to know how every other couple did their proposal!! ",excited,wholesome

"It's not much, but it always makes my day Alright, so this isn't the start of a love story, so: sorry for all those who would like that.

But the story starts like this: When I was in school, there was this girl, who always seemed to dislike me. We didn't have any rivalry or anything, I just probably wasn't likeable to her, not that surprising, since I was really weird at times as a child. Some time after graduating school, I remember some sort of interaction where, at the end of it, she told me something like ""You're not as bad as I thought you'd be"" and that was pretty much the last word we ever spoke.  
Last year, I started working in a book store not far from where I grew up and I think a month ago, this girl came walking in. We didn't talk much, but I could eventually help her find the book she wanted. It wasn't the first time, that someone from there came to the store, but all of them, even friends from then, never returned after finding out I work there. No one but my best friend, who pops in from time to time, and this girl who used to hate me, but now she comes by regularly, we even exchange a bit of small talk every time.  
I know it's not much, but it gives me peace to know, that I was able to redeem myself to someone who didn't want anything to do with me.

"My dentist gave me an eraser as a gift (I'm 25!) Hello, everyone! It's the first time I'm posting here, and I have a story that I thought would be best to share in this subreddit. 


So, first off, let me introduce myself: I'm Ali, a 25-year-old man who doesn't like going to the dentist—just like everyone else! Dentist appointments have always made me nervous and shaky, but fortunately, in the past few years, I've managed to cope with this childhood fear. You might think that I did this solely by my strong, sheer, and immovable will, but that's not the case! I've had great help from my dentist! As a matter of fact, if it weren't for her, I would still be afraid of dentists.


Now, I want to introduce you to my dentist: she's a short, plump, and beautiful lady with half-moon glasses. She's cheerful, kind-hearted, approachable, and always has a smile on her face. She's genuinely adorable, and I'd guarantee that even the fussiest kids would sit quietly through an appointment with her. 


A few days ago, I called her clinic to set up an appointment because I had three slightly decayed teeth, and I wanted to prevent any further damage to them.


When I entered the room, she smiled at me and her assistant helped me sit in the dental chair. I waited while the doctor found my file and checked my history. After a couple of minutes, she came and said, ""Take off your glasses, dear,"" and I replied, ""Oh, so this time you're going to beat me up that hard!"" She laughed and said, ""Are you still afraid of me?! I've been examining you since 2010! I've pulled many of your baby teeth!"" —  actually, she's had my records since the day I came to her clinic. Indeed, after the first time my parents took me to her, I became her patient and have never visited another dentist. I remember back then she would give me small gifts for being a good boy after finishing my treatment.


When she finally finished filling my cavities, I stood up and, before leaving the room, said jokingly, ""Thank you so much. But what about my gift?""


She laughed and said, ""Oh! For sure! What do you want?"" Then her assistant pulled out a large drawer, and it was fully stocked with pens, markers, highlighters, erasers, colored pencils, automatic pencils, and many other interesting items. Many of them even had small cartoon figures on them. She said, 'what do you want? Choose one.' 


I was only joking! But she insisted I choose something as a gift. I didn't know what to say or choose, so I just took the eraser her assistant gave me. And I was like... :')

"A Child's Gift Card My daughter just turned 4 and she received a $25 gift card for Target. I decided to take her to pick out any toy/book she wanted. In the end she chose two books and we checked out. She was very excited about giving the clerk her card and checking out on her own.

So I'm walking out to the store with a very happy girl and as we get near the door, she says ""Wait, stop! I need to get this for when we come back."" She rushes over to the gift card section and starts to grab an unactivated gift card.

"My grandpa helped me… again So my grandpa just died last week. We were so close and my family isn’t handling it well. He was the nicest person on the planet and would drop anything and everything to help us (and he did). 

Well yesterday was my niece’s birthday and Mother’s Day. I bought my sister-in-law a digital camera and brought it so she could take pictures. I realized on my way to the party that I didn’t have an SD card. I asked my brother to bring one so she could actually use the camera and of course he was like “well I couldn’t find it” lol. 

I decided to just look in my grandpa’s computer desk. I opened the top drawer and pushed a pen out of the way, where I found a brand new, unopened, SD card. I picked it up and showed my mom and she was like “I have no idea why he has that”. I just started sobbing.

No drama, just… quietly trying to keep her family together.

People started pitching in. A few regulars donated. Someone made a GoFundMe. The café owner matched it. One of the knitting ladies who comes in every morning gave $1,000. It spread a little, and they raised enough to cover legal costs and then some.

She found out during a shift and just stood there wiping the counter with tears in her eyes. Now her little brother comes in sometimes after school with his backpack and a muffin, doing homework at the corner table.

My son spends one day a week with Teddy and absolutely adores him, he understands Teddy thinks and behaves differently to him but also understands that Teddy is unique, and often tells me how smart he thinks Teddy is.

"I replaced social media with reading and my brain finally started healing A few months ago, I came home from work, collapsed on my bed, and did the usual: mindlessly scrolled TikTok until my brain was mush. I kept telling myself, “I deserve this -I’m tired, I need to decompress.” But let’s be honest, it wasn’t helping. I wasn’t relaxed. I was numb. I wanted to feel better, get smarter, improve my focus…but I didn’t have the energy. Then I read Atomic Habits, and something clicked. I didn’t need to change everything. 

I just needed to start tiny.

So I ran a little experiment:
- 10-minute walk after dinner (no gym, no pressure)
- One short HIIT workout on days I had the energy
- And most importantly: I replaced TikTok with a short daily reading habit.

Instead of grabbing my phone and doomscrolling the moment I got bored, I swapped the TikTok icon with a reading app and committed to 15 minutes every night before bed. I also stacked listening to audiobooks with things I was already doing - at the gym, while cleaning, even in the shower. (Shoutout to Atomic Habits for the idea: pair a new habit with an existing one and it’ll actually stick.) Over time, it became muscle memory - and way more satisfying than doomscrolling.

The first week was HARD. I’d still open my phone looking for TikTok out of habit. But slowly… my brain stopped craving dopamine hits and started craving actual stories and ideas. After 60 days, I’d finished 8 books (more than I read all last year), my sleep improved, my brain fog eased, and weirdly enough - I felt more myself again.

Here are some underrated tips that helped me break free from social media brain rot and rebuild my focus:

- Hide the app, change the trigger. Replacing TikTok with a reading app where the icon used to be actually works.
- Don’t read to be productive - read to enjoy. Pick short, fun stuff at first.
- Habit stack like a boss. Link your reading time to routines: tea time, brushing your teeth, or commuting.
- If you’re too tired to read, listen. Audiobooks count. No gatekeeping here.
- Make it visible. Keep your current read on your lock screen or desk. Reminders work.
- Track books, not screen time. Seeing your “books finished” list grow is more satisfying than you think.


Some resources that helped me A TON (besides therapy):

Books:
- Atomic Habits by James Clear - Insanely good habit science meets real-life hacks. Best book for anyone who’s ever felt stuck in a rut. It changed how I think about motivation and momentum.
- Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport - This one will make you rethink your entire relationship with tech. Powerful read. If you’ve ever felt like your brain’s fried 24/7, read this.
- The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle - A spiritual classic that’s actually digestible. If your anxiety spirals at night, this one will feel like a warm blanket for your mind.


Tools:
- MadFit (YouTube): My go-to for low-effort, high-reward movement. Her 10-minute apartment-friendly workouts are perfect for days when the gym feels impossible. No talking, just music and good vibes.

- BeFreed: My brother at UC Berkeley put me on this. It’s a smart reading / book summary app that’s perfect if you’re too busy to read full books or struggle to stay consistent. You can choose how you want to read: 10-min skims, 40-min deep dives, or 20-min fun storytelling versions of dense non-fiction. I usually listen to the fun storytelling mode while commuting or at the gym - it helps me actually enjoy books I used to find way too dry. If one really hooks me, I’ll switch to the 40 mins deep dive. I was super skeptical at first, but after testing it with a book I’d already read, I was shocked - it covered 95% of the key points and examples. I honestly don’t think I’ll ever spend 15+ hours reading a non-fiction book again.

- Forest:  This app helped me stay off my phone while reading. You plant a little tree that grows as you stay focused - and dies if you leave to scroll 😭. Weirdly motivating, especially paired with short reading sessions.

Reading literally saved my mental health. I used to feel so drained all the time, constantly comparing myself to people online, scrolling to escape. Now, I read to come back to myself. If you’re in that stuck, burnt-out place - this is your sign. Try one small switch. One short read. One walk without your phone. It really adds up.
And if no one’s told you lately: you’re not broken. You’re just tired. Start small. You got this. 💛",excited,wholesome

Background: he's in his early 50's, never exercised intentionally, has early heart disease issues.

We've been training for a little over a month now, outside of Passover, and his blood pressure has been improving incrementally, his movement patterns and core bracing are getting more dialed in and mobility is improving. 

He has a good sense of humor and strong work ethic, despite operating outside of his comfort zone. This interaction is mutually beneficial and inspiring to see someone committed to bettering themself.

"Mother’s Day always reminds me how the smallest things mean the most. 💛 With Mother's Day coming up, I found myself thinking about a small memory from last year.

I didn’t do anything extravagant — I just picked out a simple bracelet for my mom.  
It wasn’t expensive, it wasn’t flashy.  
Just a few soft-colored stones on a simple thread. Simple.

I honestly thought she’d wear it once or twice and forget about it.

But instead, it became her little constant.  
She wears it almost every day now, even when she’s just lounging at home.  
Sometimes I see her absentmindedly touching it when she’s thinking.

She never said much about it.  
But I can tell — somehow, that little bracelet became a reminder.  
A small quiet thing that says, ""I'm here.""

More recently, he drove me and my twin 30 minutes to view a movie we'd been looking forward to! When we got back we were talking about it in the car.

Later, my twin saw our dad on the wiki LITERALLY researching the movie and it's lore!!! By choice!!

"The story of my favorite person. I just want to share with the Reddit a little bit about how I’ve grown up together my favorite person in the world. There is so much negativity everywhere, I want folks to know there is solace and fulfillment that can be found. This is by no means a story of perfection, because we’re not that at all, but she is perfect for me.

My wife is the person I speak of, for a long time growing up I knew her as this little blonde girl names Tina (pseudonym). We knew each other from church growing up and generally didn’t get along at all from the ages of 7-15. I was a serious know-it-all and she was anything but serious as a child, always laughing and full of joy. 

Once I got my license things began to change. She was in band and I played guitar Thursday nights with one of the science teachers, after band she liked to come listen…and sometimes I’d drive her home. We started spending more time together with our group of friends, and by the time we turned 17 I had grown quite fond of Tina. I asked her out, she told me I had to ask her Dad (picture a bigger stronger Sam Elliot).  He gave us permission to go out, so off the the movies we went.  The date was great until I royally overplayed my hand….i thought I was so smooth…asked if I could kiss the poor girl and nearly suffocated her with my tongue (as stupid overconfident teens might do).  That led to a awkward drive home and no dates for the foreseeable future.

When I tell y’all I was smitten….i mean it.  I couldn’t do anything but beat myself up and long for Tina for MONTHS. Near the end of our senior year we buddied back up again, and I declared my undying affection….she told me I was “like a brother”….devastated doesn’t begin to describe my anguish….I’m convinced(now) she was torturing me for the botched first kiss.  Somehow my grandpa’s number showed up on her parents caller ID (to this day I have no clue how/why) and she called me.  I shot my last shot (I promise I wasn’t being a creeper, we didn’t stop being friends through the entire ordeal), and she actually wanted to go out again!!!  From then on we were inseparable buddies all summer…the eventual next kiss went much better and was followed by many more.   

As college approached we had a big issue…about 400 miles between our chosen schools.  She also has some pause, because she “knew” if we stayed together we would get married.  I promise y’all, i would have drug my most delicate bits across broken glass on the way to the alter for her then. 

To shorten the story a bit, after a couple months of consideration and a couple weeks at college we decided we were “official”…it might has well been an engagement, although out of respect for our parents that didn’t come for nearly a year and a half.  Our first year of college I probably drove 30,000 miles running back and forth on weekends, minor holidays, and the time she got food poisoning and needed serious help. I stayed with a friend who attended her university or with her older sister & BIL every-time I went.  

That spring we started planning our whole life together out…we picked out rings and she got her dream wedding dress custom made on the cheap(good ole eBay).  In hindsight we should’ve just eloped then, but both of us were determined to handle things traditionally and not give our parents heart attacks.  We had also determined to save ourselves for marriage.  We survived on corny movies, really chapped lips, and lots of frustration 🤣.

Fast forward to the fall, she decided to join me where I was going to college(I probably should’ve transferred to her, hindsight is 20/20). It was great to be close.  Things went really well and we got officially engaged in February of the next year.  We set the date for spring break the following year, and began planning our “dream” college student hobby-lobby wedding. 

The wedding finally rolled around, and she was the most beautiful bride I’d ever seen. The ceremony went by with no surprise and we were surrounded by friends and family.  After the ceremony we had planned to go to our new home that was 300miles away to begin our honeymoon.  Earlier that day my Mom had palmed me $200 “just-in-case”, and we couldn’t have been more grateful about halfway to our destination…I don’t know if either of us have ever been that tired since.  With the best room that Holiday inn and dinner the attached restaurant had to offer, we enjoyed our first night as husband and wife. The next day was a marathon drive to a week a Disney (it was fun, but we would’ve went somewhere else in hindsight).

Being married our last 2 1/2 semesters of college was a challenge.  I was determined to spoil my princess while navigating a social work program while she went to nursing school.  We both graduated without any issues other than a never ending mountain of crippling debt(first generation of college goers in either family, had no clue what we were doing with our money). 

The next 6 years was a whole lot of growing up together. We didn’t always agree on things, and certainly didn’t always make amazing decisions…but we never stopped loving each other, and we never gave up. She moved on from her first floor to an ICU position, and I moved out of working in a nursing home to a mental hospital. We learned a little better everyday how to support one another. 

In the 7th year of our marriage we had our beautiful daughter Courtney(also a pseudonym). Courtney was a caul birth, and has been a blessing to our lives. Pregnancy was exceedingly difficult for Tina, between gestational diabetes, postpartum depression, and the worsening of her ADHD that had been manageable without medication prior…it began a new chapter in our marriage.  I learned how to truly become a rock for our family.  Seeing my wife hurting from “demons”  that I couldn’t fight for her was humbling.  I learned love through service, and with time and some amazing people she was able to heal her body and mind. 

In the 9 years since we have continued to grow and thrive. We have our struggles of course, but what has kept us together and strengthened us has been uncompromising honesty, striving together to imitate Christ(and encourage one another in that walk), and never giving up when things get hard.  Extended family has been hard, maintaining a home is rough,  jobs have sometimes been hard, the now lightly dented aforementioned mountain of debt still exists. I don’t worry about those things because Tina is there. I can count on her to do the right thing, encourage me when I’m upset, never give up on me…I need her more than I need any part of my body, because without her nothing would ever work right again.   I know she feels exactly the same because she tells me constantly how much more she loves me now that when we were 18 year old kids.   We haven’t stopped growing closer since the day we started dating. I hope I get to spend everyday for the remainder of my life continuing to give Tina all the love that I can, because I know she will be doing the same. 

If you’ve read this far, I appreciate you.  I hope that you find/have found your perfectly imperfect someone as well.  Support them, love them more than yourself, and when things aren’t easy, love and support them more.

"Found out what my dad ""sacrificed"" for me 15 years ago. I'm f32 and recently found out about something my dad did 15 years ago. I can't stop thinking about it, and it brings a smile to my face when I'm feeling down. 

My dad smoked a lot when I grew up. Like about 2 packs a day. When I learned about the dangers of smoking in school, I started to ask him to quit. He never listened, his addiction was just greater than all my begging, bickering and educating, apparently.

Then, at 17 years old, I started having health issues. It was while my parents were on a month long vacation without me (I forgot where to, but it doesn't really matter). It turned out I have ulcerative colitis - chronically inflamed intestines, so basically cramps and bleeding from the butt, as if periods weren't enough already. I basically went through this alone, since my bf back then was shitty support.

So anyway, I got an appointment super quickly, immediately had a diagnosis after a colonoscopy and some blood work was done and got on medication right away (thanks European Healthcare!). So from the moment I decided to see a doctor and tell my parents about my symptoms maybe a week passed until I had my medication. Still, it was a scary and painful week. But since 15 years passed since then, I haven't really thought about it that much.

Now a few weeks back my dad was talking to my husband and told him something he never told anyone before. I wasn't supposed to ever know, but I'm glad my husband can't keep secrets. Back when my parents got the news about me having health problems, my dad was scared out of his mind. He had lost his mom to ovarian cancer that was diagnosed way too late, so he jumped to the worst scenario and thought he might lose his only child as well. Now, my dad is an atheist, but when he heard about my issues, he decided to pray. Just this once, and it was more of a barter, really. He prayed and offered that he'd do anything to make my health issues go away. He thought about it and didn't really have anything to sacrifice, so he figured if he gave up smoking - the hardest thing for him to do, he could prove that he'd do anything for me.

And he did it. Quit cold turkey, without nicotine patches or other helpers, from 40 cigarettes to 0 just like that. Must have been even harder considering he was under a lot of stress due to worrying about me. I never knew, just thought that he, for whatever reason, decided to do something for his own health. Never would I have guessed he did it for mine.

[Now I don't care what people think about the outcome of the prayer. I'm neither implying that God exists and healed me, nor do I want to fight anyone who believes that. I do know that I can thank proper medical care for getting better, and that I'm lucky it was just colitis and nothing worse.

Anyway, religion is not what I'm focusing on here. I'm just so, so, thankful to have a father who loves me so much more than I ever imagined and would do anything for me. And I'm really hoping my husband and I can live up to those standards as parents for our daughter, who would have been due yesterday but apparently decided to take her sweet time to meet us.

"I Got Ding-Dong Ditched by Angels I just wanted to share something amazing that happened not too long ago and I hope it puts the biggest smile on your face like it did mine 😁

It's mid-afternoon and my mom and I were in the kitchen making homemade sushi and jamming out to The Cranberries when we hear the doorbell ring. We both look at each other in confusion for a brief moment because neither of us were expecting anyone.. So I immediately walk over to the door and look out the peep-hole... Nobody's there. I waited a couple mins and then opened the door (we also have a locked screen door on the outside of the front door), and right away I see 2 small folded up pieces of paper laying on the ground. I'm looking around like what the heck? Is this some kind of weird prank? So I quickly open the screen door, grab the papers, and go back inside, and I unfold these tiny notes to find what is clearly the handwriting of a child.

One note says ""Dear Neighbor, continue dreaming, working hard, and being awesome. No one is just like you. Love, S.O. Happy for you.""
The other note says ""Dear neighbor, when the going gets tough, the tough get going! You got this! Just work it out! I know you can do it so just try your hardest. Signed - Anonymous Neighbor"". (I included pics from my mom's Facebook post).

When I tell you my heart INSTANTLY MELTED. 🫠

So my mom and I decide to check our cameras to see who left the notes, and lo and behold it was 2 darling little girls around the ages of 8-10. We watched them carefully and quietly tip-toe up to our house, grab the notes out of a bag, toss them on the ground and ring our doorbell, and then take OFF. We were cracking up! It was the best ding-dong ditching that's ever happened to me and I must say, whoever is raising these sweet girls is raising them right! That small act of kindness meant the absolute WORLD to us, and even though the girls don't know this, the encouragement and support those simple words carried were exactly what we needed at the time.

I ended up seeing them strolling down my street again about an hour later while I was walking my dog and they were hugging each other, holding hands, and giggling like crazy. It was the CUTEST THING EVER! What I would do to be that age again! 👭

I never saw them before that and I haven't seen them since, and although I'm not a religious person at all, I do believe the universe brought them to our door that day for a reason. And if you're reading this post right now, I believe you were meant to see those notes for a reason too.

I would love the opportunity to thank them one day, and I would definitely love to shake their parents hands as well. THAT is what life is all about, my friends. Spreading love and good vibes. ☮️

It sorta makes me wonder.. what would the world look like if everyone was doing kind things like this for each other every day?

All I know is.. now, I am determined to pay it forward.

"I got a dream opportunity! I have been a paid gigging musician for over 15 years, but playing music for about 20 years. I've always been a great singer, but have been limited by what I'm capable of playing on guitar. My husband and I started playing music together about 10 years ago, and for the past 5 years we have been playing every weekend together. We love it and consider it a date night every time. Due to life circumstances, we have to take a few months off of playing out.

I just got a message from a very popular local band that I sang with as part of a charity event a couple of years ago. They said they are losing their lead singer soon and wanted to see if I would be interested in the job. They pay market rate, are happy to merge our set lists and - get this - when I told them I'm ""offline"" for the next few months, they said ""You're worth the wait, we'll make it work until you can join.""

I can't believe it. These are like 30+ year vets on the local music scene. I feel like I got to skip the line somehow. I'm so honored and excited. Plus now I have a job when I'm ready to go back to work!!

I know anything could change, but literally just being asked makes me feel 100 feet tall. I'm just beaming.",excited,wholesome

"Cute Hotel Guest Hi! I (24f) work as a housekeeper at a hotel in my town. I started a month ago and have been learning the ins and outs if it all. Well there is this family that lives there because their house had flooded. They have two rooms side by side and are the sweetest. A couple days ago i was refreshing the rooms ans noticed the little girl had left her stuffies on the bed. Normally if a guest leaves items on the beds we cant touch them, but i knew their situation and just moved them and made the bed before moving them back. After i had placed her stuffies back i left a note saying that they were Handled with Care. The next day i go in and notice a little paper next to her bed. She left me a note back! 

For context anytime i do their rooms i leave a note for the parents explaining any changes or shortages we have. But i always leave a motivational or just a nice note for the kiddos. I noticed she a ceiling projector with stars and left one saying “reach for the stars!” Just those little things. 

I never expect anything from anybody, but when i saw this i nearly cried because it let me know that even just taking some time write a positive little note is helping a little girl when shes going thru a tough time. But she is also helping me because i get excited to see if shes left another one.

"Gave my teachers gifts today Hi everyone so I just wanted to share something my class did for our Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology teachers. We’ve been planning to get gifts for them since we’re in our senior year and we love them all so much. They’ve done so much for us and I’m going to miss them so much. I doubt I’ll ever see them again after our exams end in June.

So yeah, I set everything up, put all the gifts in the gift bags, and we also made a poster where everyone wrote a small message. When I first gave the gift to my Chemistry teacher, she got SO emotional. Her face went all red and she started crying. It was so emotional and it kind of made me tear up too not gonna lie. She loved it so much. She’s a huge fan of cats, so we got her this really cute and soft cat plushie with the Starry Night painting in the middle, plus a few other things. She kept the cat plushie with her the whole class because she loved it. We also got her an insulated cat mug and she started using it right away, it was so cute.

For my Psychology teacher, we got her a Pandora charm, a keychain with her name on it, flowers, and chocolates. (We’ve got prom on Saturday, so we plan to take a picture with her and all her students and get it made into a mug since she loves coffee and hot drinks.) She started tearing up too, it was really emotional. She’s actually my favorite teacher, and she’s the reason I want to study psychology at uni. She’s just such an amazing teacher, and I’ll miss her so much. She loved the poster with all the messages and immediately put the keychain on her keys. It was so nice.

Finally, for our Biology teacher, we had the gifts at the back of the classroom. As soon as she came in, we said surprise and clapped. Then we gave her the gift and the poster with the messages. She started tearing up too—not as much as the others, but she was so grateful and loved the gifts. We got her a Rituals gift set, a Stanley mug (lol), chocolates, and flowers. She kept saying how much she loved us and how we’re her favorite cohort—not just because of the gifts, but because of how we behave in class and our good grades.

I’d been planning this for weeks. It was hard and stressful to get everyone to cooperate and to buy the gifts, but it was totally worth it. I’m really going to miss this batch and my teachers who’ve taught me so much.",excited,wholesome

With the solemnity of someone performing an ancient rite, she held a small piece of Funyun up to each person in turn, making gentle eye contact like, “This is for you, if you need it.” No words, just pure generosity. People smiled, laughed, most politely declined, but she kept going, undeterred, like it was her duty.

She didn’t say much, but her whole being was expressive. She was open-hearted and serious about her mission of crunchy, onion-flavored goodwill.

Honestly, it was the most tender moment of my day. Possibly my week.",excited,wholesome

""We can have grape pop and grape kool-aid (for the kids)!"" His favorite flavor is grape.
""And we can make fried chicken!"" He also loves fried chicken.

SIL called me the next day laughing and told me what happened. My oblivious brother was absolutely crestfallen and horrified when SIL gently mentioned that those are black stereotype foods and it might be taken the wrong way. Of course when I told my husband he laughed and said ""who doesn't like fried chicken though?""

Later, at the party when my husband greeted everyone he said ""I heard there'd be fried chicken?"" Everyone laughed and joked about it. Unfortunately, the menu had been changed and both my husband and brother were disappointed with no fried chicken.",excited,wholesome

This year, though, it all kind of hit me. I hugged my dad and just let it out, telling him how sad it made me not getting anything from them. I spent my 19th birthday out all day grabbing as many birthday freebies as I could, just trying to enjoy the day.

"I have sung the song Take Me Home, Country Roads to my special educator and her family on the phone Yesterday in my country, there was the occasion of Ram Navami. I called my special educator Mahua Paul ma'am on the phone and she told me that I would be singing the song in the evening. I am absolutely anticipated and excited about that one. So in the evening at 7:30 pm I have chosen the song Take Me Home, Country Roads by the legendary late John Denver and I have started listening to the whole song. Once I have completed listening, I brought my notebook and pen. As a proud and humble student, left handed, family girl, singer and a music lover who is also a low pitched Contralto voice type kind of a person, it is absolutely easy for me to be legible in my own handwriting and find my own vocal range. I have started writing the lyrics of the song, then I have listened to the song in a very slow speed so many times for the notes, then I have started writing the notes and octave numbers which fit my own vocal range. I have chosen the scale of C Major Scale for my rendition whereas the original version of the song is A Major Scale. After remembering the lyrics and the notes so many times I called her on the phone at 9:18 pm and told her that I would be singing the song Take Me Home, Country Roads as the late John Denver is her and her husband Vikramaditya sir's favourite singer. She called her daughter Casuarina and Vikramaditya sir has also came to listen to my rendition together. After checking the connection she called me again as I have worn the airpods so that my voice would be audible. I asked her whether I should start and she immediately said, “Yes!"" I have poured my own heart out and completed the whole song and after completing that the three of them have clapped and gave me the compliments. He told me that my voice is suitable for the fast paced type of songs like this. I am absolutely honoured and grateful that the moment never fails to make me smile and I can say that I have been her student and her best friend who always trusts and supports me a lot for more than fourteen years since 2011.",excited,wholesome

"Pikachu Tale Last week was my daughter's birthday and she wanted all Pokémon stuff. I found a cool Pikachu balloon for like $3 and got it for her (not the only present she got, but the primary one in the story). This thing ended up being almost bigger than me and she LOVED IT! The next day she went off to school and was so excited to tell EVERYONE about her giant Pikachu balloon.

While she was at school the toddlers got ahold of it and gave it too loving a hug that popped it. When I tried to retrieve it from them, the tail ripped off. I felt awful and tried ordering another but they were all gone. I tried finding it elsewhere but it was $28-37. Maybe I can fix it? I pulled out my iron and closed up the tail hole and it looked pretty good. However, it wouldnt stay inflated, so there was still a hole I couldn't find. So I decided to use the balloon as a pattern to make a giant stuffed Pikachu! I got everything traced, cut out and most of it sewed together before climbing up her bunk bed to tape balloon Pikachu to the ceiling so she'd have it as a cool decoration.

When I got to the top of her bed I found the tear! By this point she'd be home in about 15 mins. I quickly taped the hole and inflated Pikachu! Success! I gently placed Pikachu on her bed and went to get her from the bus. She immediately went to Pikachu and started playing with it.

Later, I asked her what she wanted to do with it when it deflated and suggested taping it above her bed. She LOVED the idea and asked me to deflate Pikachu now and tape it to the ceiling 🤦🏼‍♀️. I tried, but it wouldn't deflate without popping again. She was sad, but went to play with it some more. While making dinner I hear ""I love you Pikachu!"" then POP! She'd given it a big hug and its foot popped nearly all the way off. Again she was sad, but excited to wake up to see Pikachu every day.

So I spent ALL DAY trying to replace, fix, or make a new Pikachu, just for her to want me to deflate and tape it to the ceiling anyway, lol!  ",excited,wholesome

"A game creator gave me his game's steam key I won't say who it is, or which game it is for privacy reason.

I was very active on the game's discord server, reporting bugs, that were all associated with the demo version of the game, since my family's too poor to buy a 20 $ early access.

After some months, the game's creator asked me ""you still haven't bought the early access ?!?"" so i explained my situation to him.

Some hours after that, he send me a pm with... the steam key of the early access ! He then asked me to not tell anyone in the server that he did that.

Btw, the game is regularly updated, and when the final game will be released, i will have access to it.

"I am now the office 'Young People' expert....and I love it. So I(38F) work in an office of mostly folks in their late 30s and 40s...me included. The only big difference is that I am one of the few who doesn't have kids ( I am a DINK). Now unlike the horror stories I hear on Reddit, my coworkers are great and they never make their kids anyone else's issue. I actually love hearing about their weekends and seeing adorable photos on the community boards on Teams. Its a nice environment to work in.

Having worked for the business for over a decade I have cultivated a reputation for being cheerful, hardworking, energetic---and a bit childish. When I say 'Childish' I mean that I like often like kid-oriented media. I will perk up when someone says their kid is playing a certain game or someone will notice my one of my coffee mugs durning a Teams meeting and ask about the cartoon character on it. 

You see, my partner and I both love all forms of media and are not prejudicial based on who the media was originally targeted for. We will happily watch a string of gory horror films followed up with a few episodes of *Bluey.* The last three games on my Deck played were *Binding of Issac, Outer Worlds* and *Dreamlight Valley.* This year so far I read two Stephen King books and reread the *Percy Jackson* series. This is just to show that while I enjoy adult-oriented media I will watch/play/listen/read anything if people say it has value and a good story.

So this reputation has created an interesting side effect. I now have people calling/DMing me with questions to help them better understand their kids. Here are some examples:

* Woman with a rather shy pre-teen daughter was asking about books for her birthday. She sent me a photo of her daughter's book shelf and I could see there was a related series to one of the ones the daughter had so I recommended it. The daughter absolutely love it. 
* I have a guy who calls me to ask all about the new *Pokémon* games and how to play for his young son. He knows I have played every title so he comes with a list of questions from his kid to ask ( I am now the 'Pokémon Lady' at his dad's job). I know he could google it but he appreciates that I explain in a way he can understand. It is adorable that he carefully writes down my answers so he can help his son later. 
* Slang - At least once a week I get an DM asking me to explain some meme, slang or Youtube thing. It is mostly funny until a lady asked (NSFW) >!what 'Gooning' was ( Hired Goons!) !<That was an awkward one....but we had a good laugh.
* Movie Checks - My husband and I watch a lot of films so we have usually seen every major thing that has come out. I often get asked about sensitivities, such as animal distress or blood for their kids who might get scared. I also use this as a way to recommend other, less well-known movies and shows. 

This is just to say that I love the people at my job. It makes me happy to see parents actively trying to understand their kids better and connect with them. I also like that they in no way judge me for my interests...they see it as a strength!

Have a great day folks!

"They named me Pooja Lived in Bombay for a year while prepping for some stuff, and my cleaning Didi would sometimes talk to me while working. Not in a chatty way, just little things about her life. Three kids, two of them twins, husband not around. Works long hours, never complains, never asks for anything. One day she mentioned how rent keeps going up, how saving feels impossible.

I don’t earn much, was a student, but that day I felt like doing something as I was leaving soon. Her kids’ birthday was coming up, they wanted to dress as butterflies. She didn’t ask, but I gave her five times her salary and my old guitar for the kids. Just felt right in the moment.

She used to bring me litti chokha on Sundays because she knew I liked it. That small thing always stayed with me.
Her kids used to call me every morning at 10 AM to ask, “Didi, did Mama leave?” because she never carried her phone. They once told her, “That didi speaks so sweetly, the other didi you work for is so rude.""

Today, on their birthday, they video called me. Just to say thank you.

Don’t know if I made their day, but they definitely made mine.
Oh, and my actual name isn’t even close to Pooja. But their mom couldn’t pronounce it, so Pooja it is. And honestly, I love it.

"The “short” version of finding love during one of the worst parts of my life My fiancé loves watching Reddit stories on YouTube and has always said our story would make a good one to listen to so I finally sat down to write it and throw it up on a couple subreddits and maybe they’ll stumble across it one day. Apologies in advance for how long this is going to be (there’s going to be a TLDR at the bottom, pinky promise), but if you need a little bit of hope or wholesome content, sit tight. So, anyways: I (29, enby) met my partner (30, enby) when my boss convinced me to go to the speaker’s seminars I had been avoiding.

Some back story: I’m a geneticist, I manage a lab at a research university for a professor who researches metabolic conditions. I got the gig fresh out of my Masters program in, you guessed it: poetry (didn’t see that coming, right?) What happened was I realized I didn’t want to be a starving artist forever and decided to fall back on what I studied in undergrad, which was genetics. I know a lot of research institutions have different roles for “lab managers,” but at mine it’s a research assistant on steroids, I think other places call them “research operations managers.” I physically do the research experiments, but I also teach and train students on techniques, handle ordering for the lab, oversee our mouse colony, handle maintenance, preparation, and upkeep of instruments and reagents we use regularly, clean and dispose of hazardous waste and biohazards, manage the student’s projects, and help work on grants and publications. Now, I haven’t always done ALL of that, but it’s slowly been added to my plate over the years.

Considering that I had been away from science for two years and only had about three years of lab experience that wasn’t internship based, when I first started my role I was OVERWHELMED. Not to mention that I had just come out of a severe relapse of Schizoaffective Disorder (Bipolar Disorder PLUS Schizophrenia), which has previously been very well controlled since I was 22 with medications. But essentially, my medications had stopped doing diddly, and I was really drowning. So couple the whole failing mental health with a really difficult and demanding new position, and I was barely hanging on.

So anyways, that backstory in place—my university has visiting lectures from other researchers around the world once a week. It’s for students and staff to keep up with advances in the field as well as to build collaborative networks between institutions. My boss (we called them PIs for Primary Investigator, so if I use that here and there know it’s not Ace Ventura), wanted me desperately to go to them since I’m still a young researcher and they’d be good for me. However, I was very much NOT going because I was still figuring out how to handle running the lab and couldn’t spare an hour once a week (in my head, that is, I totally could have) to go listen to people talk in an auditorium. This was a running back and forth with us for the first 8 months I worked in his lab, him pleading with me to go and me saying “if I finish up X, Y, AND Z, by 11am, I can go.” Of course I never managed to finish it in time because I would give him the list that would take me until 7pm to finish.

Eventually, as it happened, a visiting scientist for the talk that week was working on using stem cells for differentiation models in adipocytes, something I was having a really hard time with. I was trying to make a cell line the lab could use for CRISPR knockouts that could be a stable cell line (since the stem cells if maintained well can be a near-infinite source of cells we could generate gene knockouts in and keep passaging them rather than having to re-do the knockouts in primary cell lines for every experiment), and it was proving to be REALLY difficult. So my PI said, YOU ARE COMING BECAUSE THIS MAN COULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR PROBLEM. I finally gave in and showed up, but my stubborn ass had planned to sit at the WAAAAAAAAAAY back of the auditorium and make sure that my PI saw I was there but leave halfway through the talk to go take care of my cells and experiments. So I sat in the aisle seat of the last row of this entirely filled auditorium (the aisles are on either side a single bulk of seats, so there’s a walkway to the door and nobody sitting on the other side of me, I could slip out the back easily without causing a disruption).

The talk started and it was good, honestly picked up a thing or two that I could try with my cells, I generally enjoyed it, but after 15 minutes I was starting to eye the exit (not a fan of crowds with my Schizophrenia, and this was relatively soon after COVID lockdown restrictions had been eased, so also another mark against large gatherings of people in a room for me), when walking through the door, another person showed up late to the talk and sat the two feet away from me in the aisle of the back row where I was. It was going to be difficult to make my escape without stepping over them in some way.

But—as they sat down in the aisle I looked over at them and OH MY GOD THEY WERE GORGEOUS. Now, to be fair, masking in public was still required, so I couldn’t see ALL of their features, but when I say this was the most beautiful human being I had ever seen based on 60% of their face, I MEAN IT. Needless to say, I stayed for the whole talk, and was getting up the courage to say something before this person left, but they ducked out right as the post presentation questions started, and I missed my shot. I did stay to ask questions and chat with the presenter and (eight months later) I managed to develop a cell line the lab uses, so that was a win at least. So, yeah, the only talk I was ever going to go to ended up being worth it. The problem was I couldn’t get the late and beautiful aisle sitting scientist out of my head. I was having DREAMS about them, was listening to 80s power ballads playlists, I HAD A CRUSH LIKE I WAS NINE AGAIN. So, next week I went early to the talk. And I brought a bag to set in the seat next to me as a small reservation, just in case they showed up again to sit in the aisle (I’m a dumb dumb, they’d probably show up on time, if at all, and sit farther up in the auditorium like a normal person without Schizophrenia-related social anxiety). They didn’t show up. I went again the following week, same seat same bag, nothing. I was starting to lose hope. To be fair, there wasn’t any hope, I was just a daydreaming fool who hadn’t had a good relationship in the years since my college girlfriend left me after a particularly nasty psychotic episode when she cracked and realized she wasn’t going to be able to handle my mental illness, and to be fair, I don’t blame her. I was really sick and not managing it well and honestly was toxic to have in your life at that point (but that’s another story, I’m MUCH better now, I promise). Realistically though, a lot of researchers here whether scientists or postdocs or RAs or students, are in their late 20s and 30s, so they’re either married, engaged, in long term relationships, etc. So even if I talked to this person there was no guarantee they would even be available, and to be fair, interested even.

So, after about four weeks of going to the talks and not seeing the late and beautiful scientist who was possible even maybe married or would hate me I was ready to give up. Then LO AND FUCKIN BEHOLD THEY SNEAK IN LATE. So I’m sitting there. Right? With my little bag next to me. AND THE PERSON I’M DAYDREAMING ABOUT WHILE LISTENING TO HEART AND PAT BENATAR WALKS IN JUST LIKE I HAD BEEN DAYDREAMING ABOUT. And they quietly slink over and tap me on the shoulder to ask “hey, is anybody sitting there?” OH MY GOD. PANIC. SHOT. OUT. OF. MY. ASSHOLE. If I didn’t have literal mass enough to engage gravity I would have shot out of the ceiling and to the moon. No, Jupiter. Anyways, I moved the bag, they sat down. I couldn’t breathe. I’m a grown ass person and it felt like getting a valentine from my crush in 2nd grade and I was the only person that got “<3 Name” versus “from, Name.” So the talk goes by, and I am SWEATING. Mini anxiety attack. Rehearsing this moment in my head for a month did not help in the least. Because when the talk ended, I sprinted out of the room. I ran track in college. Not even during a race then did I run this fast, probably.

I kicked myself for the next couple days, I had blown it. I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t go into a depressive episode over my disappointment in myself. I just gave up the idea of the whole meeting them again thing. My panic was greater than my will. So, fast forward to Friday (the talk was on Monday), and the Genetics Department is having a retreat, team building, career building talks, poster presentation stuff, that whole gist. I was going to go, but as a new hire (I’d only been here about 10 months at this point) my PI wanted me to at least make an appearance. The retreat started at 8am and went till about 6pm, dinner was served at 4:30pm. I did my lab work and showed up at 5:00pm, in time for the free food. I figured what better time to show up than the end where there’s also food. Sit down, eat, chit chat a bit with my PI and his friends in the department, leave for the first of my weekend naps. Only problem is that all the seats at these round tables are filled up (minus a couple seats at random tables on the outskirts). Well, I got lucky. One of the PhD students in my lab was sitting with the other computational biology students and there was a couple empty seats at their table. Grab food, sit down, talk a bit, we’re cooking now. As I’m sitting there shoving sliders in my mouth GUESS WHO COMES BACK FROM USING THE RESTROOM AND SITS DOWN THERE BECAUSE IT’S THEIR TABLE… late and beautiful and maybe possibly already married scientist. I’ve needed the Heimlich twice in my life (mozzarella sticks both times, you can judge me, TGIFridays attempted multiple assassinations), and this was very nearly the third.

So said individual sits down and starts talking to folks at the table and this is the first time I’ve seen them sans mask, and they’re way way way more attractive than I could have even imagined. Here’s the thing—they’re talking about being discharged from the psych ward after a particularly bad manic episode and that student health insurance is god awful. And as someone who was trying not to eavesdrop but who had, just three days before, gotten an ECT treatment because my meds weren’t working and the docs thought it might stimulate certain neural pathways to reinstitute the efficacy of my meds, I had to start the conversation. Well turns out, Melanie (fake name) not only had Bipolar Disorder (like me) but was also genderqueer like me! We HIT IT OFF. Turns out they’d assumed I was a new student and despite them being almost done with their PhD, started going to new student events and networking workshops for the past month hoping to run into me again before they tried the seminars again and when I’d bounced so quickly assumed I was a post doc who was already married (😂😂😂).

Our first date was the next night. We went to a disco spot, then to karaoke where I (notorious for disregarding parking rules) parked in a no-no spot and got towed so we Ubered back to their place and stayed up all night talking until they took me to get my car the next morning from the impound. On that first night I snooped around their bookshelves and found two of my favorite poetry collections of all time (not necessarily obscure but also not on the bestseller list, and unless you study poetry in school you likely won’t be introduced to these writers), so they fact they as someone who had never taken a poetry class or workshop or anything like that had read them was a minor miracle probabilistically.

When they found out I was also Schizophrenic they bought books about it to learn more: medical texts, essay collections about people living with the condition, and so on. When I had my first major episode around them, they were incredible. One of my huge paranoias/psychoses is that I see a man who is trying to kill me. Once during undergrad I disappeared for a few days because I was being “hunted” and the cops found me on the side of the highway passed out. My thighs were chafed and bleeding from running around for days in jeans. So I had a similar episode where I was convinced this man was in their closet. They got in the closet and sat there for hours until my psychoses subsided so I knew there was nobody in there but Melanie. Two weeks into the relationship we were slow dancing in the living room at 3am when they said to me “I think I love you.” To which I replied, “I know I love you.” We had only been dating for four months when I moved in with them.

The first night I lived there I put on a dress and makeup (I’m AMAB) and cried while vacuuming. The morning before I moved my stuff in was the last time I remember wanting to die. When I got long Covid and developed dysautonomia, I started passing out randomly at work. They took me to the ER after the third time and sat with me until dinner time, when they drove home and cooked my favorite meal before driving back and staying up all night to finish writing their dissertation which was due that weekend.

We’ve trained for marathons together (never actually got to do one yet bc dysautonomia really did a number on that plan), we run a monthly poetry and open mic, organize with an anarchist community center for multiple mutual aid things and a queer martial arts club, and they were the second author on my first primary author publication (did some computational analysis to save my PI and I some time and the headache of doing it ourselves, it took me three days to do the first set of data whereas they finished the other six in a little under three hours). When I went no contact with my family because they’re religious zealots who hate queer people, Melanie’s mother started taking trans allyship classes at the local library.

Now, look—I’m not saying love is the antidote to suffering or difficult things. I’m not saying it will cure your situation. But having someone that makes it safe to heal in whatever way is necessary and will be your life raft, is life-changing. I did the work myself, but they held me up when I needed a lift to get back on my feet. And to be able to do that in return for Melanie is also such a growing experience. They make everything good in me abundant. They make me want to be better, not just for them, or myself, but the world. Last year I filed my first patent for a novel treatment targeting insulin resistance. My Schizoaffective disorder is mostly in remission symptom-wise again (I don’t think it will ever go away if I stop managing it well), I’ve learned to live with dysautonomia mostly functionally. After years of not writing, I started my third book two months ago.

We got engaged after nine months, but waited for Melanie to finish their PhD and settle into a postdoc postition before planning the wedding. We’re getting married on Halloween this year. I’m taking their last name. Costume wedding, exchanging vows in a graveyard with just our wedding parties and their parents then having a huge reception with a bounce house, and trick or treating for children and adults, and a magician, a band we saw play for our third date, a series of our friends reading poems, among other things. They are kind, and thoughtful, and funny, and curious, and incredibly bright, ridiculously attractive, and one of the most gifted young researchers in their field. I am the luckiest person alive. And the moral of the story is: GO TO THE SPEAKER SEMINARS. YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING THAT CHANGES YOUR CAREER OR YOU MIGHT MEET YOUR SPOUSE. IDK THO. THAT’S ON YOU.

TLDR: I finally listened to my boss and went to a visiting scientist lecture after fighting not to go for almost a year and then when I went I saw a beautiful human who came in late and sat next to me in the aisle so I kept going to them and saving a seat but they didn’t come for a while. When they came again they sat in the seat and I chickened out instead of talking to them. But luckily the department retreat was that week and I randomly came late and sat at their table and now we have three cats, a healthy and supportive relationship, and are getting married in a graveyard.",excited,wholesome

"I think I really helped someone who needed it the other day The other day at work(I work at a large retail store) I was ringing up a woman who was buying a large suitcase. I asked her if she was going on a trip soon, and she said yes, but instead of a happy excited expression on her face, she looked stressed. 

“I’m going to be gone for two weeks, and I don’t know how to do that. I don’t know how to be gone and away from home for that long.” She told me.

“Can I give you a piece of advice?” I said to her. She said please. I told her “It sounds simple, but just enjoy yourself. Whatever happens at home will be there when you get back, whether you’re stressing about it or not. So just enjoy yourself, wherever you are, whoever you’re with, whatever you’re looking at in that moment. Just enjoy it.” 

She paused and stared at me, like she was processing what I just said to her. “You know… I never thought of it like that.” I then watched as the stress and fear drained from her face and was slowly replaced with a sense of calm. “I think I’m going to do just that. I’m going to enjoy myself.”

It was clear that throughout whatever this random woman buying a suitcase was going through, not one person around her has ever told her to slow down and enjoy the ride. I can only hope that she does have the best two weeks away from home, and that her happiness can be found and spread, and that ripple effect continues. 

You never know what people are going through, and how just a simple reminder to enjoy every moment can truly transform the world around you. That small seed of positivity planted in someone’s heart can grow and bloom into a garden of happiness.",excited,wholesome

Our dog would bark, not the aggressive one but the nonthreatening one where they want to get your attention. And when he barks, our neighbor would come over the door and slip the treats.

"Won a little cat's trust About 3.5 years ago, my husband and I adopted a little kitten to fill the gap after losing a very special cat quite suddenly.

"watched an oscar-nominated movie, and suddenly… my family’s hometown appeared on screen. the universe works in mysterious ways! okay, this was such a beautiful and unexpected moment that i just have to share.

i was watching a ‘Real Pain’, a movie starring Jesse Eisenberg, completely unaware of where it was filmed. then, out of nowhere, i saw a welcome sign that said Krasnystaw and i just froze.

Krasnystaw is a small town in poland, one that even many of my polish friends have never heard of. but to me, it’s not just some random place. it’s where my grandma and mom are from. it’s where i spent parts of my childhood, making memories that still feel like magic.

seeing it on screen, in an oscar-nominated movie of all things, felt surreal. it was like my past suddenly reached out and tapped me on the shoulder.

then i did some quick research and found out something even crazier, Jesse Eisenberg’s grandma was from there too. that’s when i lost it. it just felt like this invisible thread connecting everything, like some cosmic coincidence reminding me of my roots.

it was already emotional, but then i discovered that the movie premiered in Krasnystaw on November 8, 2024… which just so happens to be my birthday. i don’t even know what to make of all this but it left me feeling so warm, nostalgic, and connected.

"I may have met the man of my dreams totally by accident! To set the scene, I am a 35-year-old female who is living with my mother and stepdad while going through a horrific divorce from a malignant narcissist.  This man spent the better part of 10 years tearing apart and dismantling my already low self-esteem and sense of self brick by brick until there was nothing left.  I was done with this relationship years before it ended, and what do you expect after years of neglect, oppressive controlling over everything in my life, isolation from friends and family, and towards the end, increasingly violent physical abuse.  I finally found the courage to leave and I'm now in weekly therapy trying to rebuild my life.  But I'm happier than I've been since I don't know when!  The other day, the wedding ring this man gave me that has been stuck on my finger for years FINALLY came off and I haven't felt relief like that since the relationship ended 5 months ago.  But now to the wholesome part 😊❤️. I started working a full-time job at a warehouse right around Thanksgiving 2024 after 2 years of not being allowed to have a job because I was only allowed to work for his business.  I was so afraid going into this job, that I wouldn't be able to handle it but day by day, things got easier.  One day, as I was working on my line, a male coworker approached me and told me, ""hey, you know you have a secret admirer right?""  I laughed it off thinking, I spent 10 years with a man who would almost daily tell me that no one else would ever love me.  Two days later, on my lunch break, this secret admirer approached me and asked for my phone number which I nervously gave to him, nervously because what if it was all a cruel joke?  But it wasn't... This man worships the ground I walk on and basically just spends all day and night telling me how beautiful he thinks I am and what an amazing person I am.  I am so not accustomed to this kind of treatment but I feel lighter than air and he has awoken something in me that I thought died years ago.  For months, I was grieving because I thought I had wasted 10 of the best years of my life with a man who never loved me.  But now I know that God was just preparing me for this new man to come into my life and change everything!  I feel so blessed and fortunate every single day now.  And just happy to be alive!  So for all my fellow survivors of narcissistic abuse and domestic violence hear me when I tell you get out while you can because it's not going to get better!  But there are better days ahead for you 😊❤️. ",excited,wholesome

"Husband's simple words melted my heart Last night, close to bedtime, I (33F) was lying in bed watching Netflix on my phone when my husband (33M) walked in, lay down beside me, and pulled me close for a tight hug.

After a few seconds of lying together, I started rambling about my day. Then I stopped abruptly and said, ""Sorry, I am just ruining the mood,"" thinking he had something more physical in mind.

In response he hugged me even more tighter and said ""You say or do whatever you want. I just like spending time with you"". 

We have been together for 11 years (9 years dating + 2 years married) but this guy still melts my heart just like in the early days of our relationship.

"Procrastination makes my day I kept putting off and was procrastinating on preordering some fundraiser valentines candy gram for weeks and decided to purchase some on the day of the event pick up date. Two college age boys were manning the booth. I asked to purchase some, but they didn’t hear me and instead were nervously telling me what they were selling. I politely listened and then said “Can I have 4?” The one helping me said “WOW! YOU WANT FOUR?! ARE YOU SURE?! WE JUST SOLD 4!!!” I don’t think they were expecting to sell any as most people were there to pick up their pre-orders and they were probably voluntold to man the booth as club members.  As I was leaving the booth I realized I needed one more. I purchased my fifth and as I was leaving I could hear them say ecstatically shout “WE SOLD FIVE!!!”  I told my story to a few coworkers and they were able to go and purchase some as well.

"High School Cutie Sorry, this is long, but hopefully worth it. 

So, there was a guy I knew in high school, back in the 1990s. (I'm now 47F, he's 48M. Yep, we're old 🤣)

He was so cute and we both were nerds who loved Magic the Gathering and comics. We never dated, but I did have a crush on him. 

After high school, we really didn't see each other. He, of course dated people, so did I and our lives just went separate ways. 

I got married, had a kid and was living a really happy life. But then, I lost my husband to COVID in 2021. It was terrible and my son and I grieved horribly for a very long time. 

Some time passed and then I started going to a gaming store to play Magic the Gathering with some of my old friends from school. It was the only time I got out of the house other than medical appointments.

And at that shop I ran into my old friend I had a crush on. He was just as sweet and funny and cute as ever, even though 30 years had passed. 

It took a while, like several months, but I finally just said ""f**k it"" and asked him out, which he was surprised about, but also pleased. 

Now we've been dating for 3 months. We do all the nerdy stuff we like together: cons, Ren Faires, Magic the Gathering, tabletop games. And he's so sweet to me, and my son, and my parents and all my pets, just unbelievably nice and kind to all of us. 

Just wanted to share, because I just think it's all really sweet and maybe can let someone else know that you can find happiness again as grief recedes.

"Can you help me give my friend who is about to have a masectomy for breast cancer a wholesome moment? 🙏🏾(Info in text!) Hello and sorry if this isn't allowed here, but I have a really amazing friend who is in another country and is about to undergo a double masectomy for breast cancer. For anonymity this is my friend J. J and I actually met on reddit and bonded over our love for a reality TV show. We also bonded over the fact that we are both going through cancer. J is going through breast cancer and I am dealing with a terminal NHL cancer. 

She has become such a beacon of hope and inspiration in my life, truly an amazing wonderful young woman. J has dealt with a lot of terrible hands in life but still has the best personality and standards anyone could ask for. 

She's such a remarkable person who deserves the world, and unfortunately she doesn't have a lot of family or friends to connect with at the moment due to understanding she needs to come before others for once during these trying times. 

I know this may not be allowed here so mods please remove if not, but if anyone could just write a few words of encouragement or some advice they'd give/any love and support, you would be making her day. 

Her surgery is on Wednesday and she doesn't know I'm making this post, but believe me when I say she would appreciate it ever so much. This is also a reminder to please get cancer screening and find support if you or someone you know has cancer or you haven't gotten checked. Much love reddit ☝🏾❤️",excited,wholesome

"Met a stranger from Reddit on V Day So this woman posted in my city sub that she’s been trying to make friends and how she’s been feeling lonely since most of her friends left the city. A lot of comments poured in, I also gave few suggestions which she would execute, and then just casually commented that we could be friends. Things moved to DM and we got talking about different things. This was Thursday. 

I teased her what she is doing on V Day and she mentioned she has no plans and could meet. “I’ll take you on a date”, I said. She said she could meet casually and not on a date. Few more hours later, she wished me Happy Valentine’s Day and asked where I was taking her to. I couldn’t believe she was serious and agreed to meet. Now, the fear of being catfished or scammed crossed both of our minds and she said how she doesn’t want to be kidnapped lol. However, something felt right and I decided to go ahead.

We met on the evening of V Day. I picked her up and we were supposed to go to a cafe. Given it was V day, all places were super busy and she asked if I was comfortable to drive around the city. I happily agreed. 2.5 hours spent in pure talks, banter, life. No flirting, no touches. It was so unadulterated. We admitted, neither of us have even done something as crazy as this, and it turned out to be so good! I dropped her back and in the end, she gifted me some chocolates. I was soo happy!! I didn’t take chocolates with me as I didn’t want to make her feel awkward and think of this as a date. Now I think I should have. She was super sweet, chirpy and full of life. Hoping to meet her soon again.

Myself (f35) was working out on the chest press machine and couldn’t find any 5kg plates left… seeing as Ive started about half a year ago Im still relying on the smaller plates to work out with. I see a gym bro, tall, slim intimidating working out next to me.

I felt a bit stupid since I never realised he was actually using it and on top of that Im a massive overthinker and super shy. Anyways…

Literally, 10seconds later I see the said man approaching me with the 5kg plate handing it to me saying: there you go I can always just use another weight…

"I have become the ""adult"". I have been working in SpEd for 15 years with more intense needs teens. I remember when I started, I was constantly looking to senior members of the team for advice and support. We have had a lot of staffing changes over the years, and there are only two senior staff members in my department who have been there longer than I have. Furthermore, the woman of the two has been out for the last four weeks following major surgery, leaving myself and a male senior staff. 

I have been having to make major decisions regarding student behaviors with no senior input, and people have just been...listening to me?! Even other teachers who technically have more education than I do are just honoring my additional years of experience as me actually knowing what I'm doing and talking about. I started incorporating other techniques into a student's behavior plan and daily activities, sent out an email regarding it because I have been experiencing success, no one has questioned me or my methods because it has been working, and other people have just been doing because I said I did it and it worked?

And yesterday after training, I had other staff who were younger or who hadn't been there as long coming to me asking for advice on what to do for the afternoon and seeking my approval for how they did on it, and it just hit me that I am now the senior staff that I sought out for support in my early days. I have gone from the inexperienced newbie to the professional who knows what they're doing and talking about.

I had to immediately switch over to supportive adult mode without it being on the same level I do for the kids, because it made me realize what kind of position I now occupy at work, and it kind of took me by surprise because some days I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and I need an adult lol",excited,wholesome

 I am Brazilian, and seeing her speaking Portuguese like that made me so happy. 
There was room for improvement, but it was very good. But I knew how to speak English, so I asked her ""Do you know how to speak English"" and she, with a look of surprise answered me yes.
Then she tells me about leaving the Philippines and coming to Brazil.


Unfortunately, I don't remember many details, because it was very noisy, since the place is near an avenue.
But we talked about her being in my city for the 3rd time, before arriving in São Paulo she was in Rio de Janeiro.
She asked how I learned my English, I said it was just through games and videos. 
She was impressed, then she told me that she learned English through normal schools.

Then, she asks for my name. I reply, ""Arthur, and what's your name?""
She spoke, and I couldn't hear.


 I don't know why I didn't ask again. Then she offers the keychains and my father decides to buy one for me.
I may not remember the name, but I will never forget the face.
The keychain may be childish, but it will be something I will keep forever.

"Happy Friday Good morning. Happy FEEL GOOD FRIDAY you beautiful people who love Jesus. Our FEEL GOOD FRIDAY story is copied below, hope you enjoy. 

Whatever you’ve got going today, do your best to be your best and have the most excellent day that you can. 

“When first one and then both of my sons were diagnosed with Autism and mental handicaps I didn’t know the journey I was in for. It has been one that has had pain, frustration, worry, fear, anger, sadness, and despair. Yet, it has also been one that has had laughter, peace, learning, love, joy, and growth. I didn’t know then that my two sons were to become my greatest teachers in how to live and how to love.
My oldest son, JJ has an innocent love that seems frozen in an eternal childhood. He smiles and greets everyone he meets. He makes beaded key chains and homemade Christmas cards to hand out to everyone he knows. He lives a life of such sweet, unconditional love that I am always amazed by it. His younger brother, Casey has a more severe form of Autism. He doesn’t speak much and is lost in his own world most of the time. Yet, he also has a spontaneous joy that erupts at times. His laughter and smile can uplift my spirits and warm my heart on even the coldest and saddest day. I feel so blessed having both of my boys in my life. And I thank God everyday for them

Mitch Albom wrote: “ A child is both an anchor and a set of wings.” This is true for both of my sons. They anchor me in my daily work and responsibilities caring for them and they also give my soul a set of wings that connects me to love, to joy, to Heaven, and to God. It isn’t always easy having two sons over 30 trapped mentally in an eternal childhood. But spiritually they help me each day to love more deeply, to give more freely, and to share more joyously. When you see a child or adult with special needs always remember that they are also special souls. They are a gift from God and we can learn so much from them. May we all one day love as freely, as happily, and as joyously as they do”. 

•Please pray for those with special needs• “Let those who love the Lord hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.” Psalm 97:10. Have a blessed day. 143!!!

".. Idk if it’s considered wholesome but I (17f) have been playing volleyball for the past 6 months now and my older brother (20) has been playing for about 2 years now. Before I started playing he would always tell my parents how he’d quit if me or my sister started playing volleyball and that the girls in his uni don’t know how to play or play ‘too soft’ but when he found out I picked up on it he was overjoyed. Of course he didn’t show but everyone could tell. He was happy he found someone to play with anywhere at anytime. The first time he came home from uni he’d play with me in my room every day and kept telling me how I sucked but each day he’d ask me to play with him but act like he doesn’t care if I don’t wanna. Every time he asked me to play that made me smile inside cuz he would never play with me unless he actually likes it. My brother is the kind of people who doesn’t like to show emotion at all and never compliments anyone so when one slips out, you know you made it. The last time he came home from uni I have newly ordered a new ball and he probably loved it more than me even when the quality sucked. Now this time when he came I’ve improved a lot and have finally gotten a fixed position that I like and am actually good at which is setter. When I first told him he jokingly said “setter? More like shitter” which might sound toxic but insulting is his love language. I started even practicing spiking on him and one thing about me is I’m absolutely terrified of spike receive. The sound of the palm hitting the ball alone is enough to make me flinch, especially because I wear glasses and I’ve been hit in the face several times but he’s now trying to get me used to it. He always starts with just passing and setting to warm up then starts tipping the ball at me to make me squat down more and move and then gradually starts spiking at me, gradually increasing the power to get me used to the sound and feel of it. And I got a couple of compliments out of him which is huge cuz he’s not the type to say anything nice no matter what and I just feel like the thought of him saying something nice to me warms up my heart. No wonder why he’s my fav sibling ",excited,wholesome
"It takes a village So, my mom and two younger brothers and I attended Hot Wheels Fire and Glow Monster Trucks in Atlanta a few days ago. It was amazing and we had a great time, but there were a few interactions that really stood out to me. Now, it is important to note that my family and I are very white.  
  
The first one was while we were in line to get food, we were trying to decide what we wanted. There was a father and two kids behind us, all black, and they had yo-yo's, my youngest brother (5) was interested in it, he'd never gotten the hang of using a yo-yo being little, and both my mom and the dad behind us noticed his interest. My mom was thinking of where she could get him a yo-yo, and the dad, with absolutely no hesitation, took a wrapped yo-yo out of his pocked and handed it to my brother. My mom apologized, thinking my brother had been eyeing them disrespectfully. The dad laughed and said no worries and he was happy to share the toy. My brother right away started to try and figure out how to use it while we thanked the man profusely. He really did make my brothers night (other than the monster trucks, of course).

The second, and probably the more meaningful interaction, for a reason about to be evident, was when my mom took youngest sibling, leaving me (30) and my other brother (15) at our seats. Now, if you've never been to a show in Atlanta, many of the stadiums have absolutely NO walking room at all. they pack as many people into seats as possible. We were on the end cap, so people had to squeeze by us to get to the middle seats. We had no problem standing up to let people pass, but if you weren't careful you'd end up in the isle below us stuck in between the seats, with just enough room to get stuck, but not unstuck without help. Now someone I assume was a single father with his two very, very young children, about my youngest brothers age, came by (different than the first parent). He and both of his kiddos were, you guessed it, black. Now! He let the two kiddos go first so he could watch them, as you do, and the first kiddo, a little boy... fell in between the space between the seat and the isle and got stuck. It took about three seconds before I moved into action, realizing that the father was holding a very full cup in one hand and food in the other. Now, as soon as I realized he was in like, real trouble, I moved to help. Thankfully the little boy wasn't hurt at all, if just confused by what happened. I reached down and helped pick him and and plant him firmly on the ground before letting him go so they could continue. The father thanked me several times, I just laughed and told him it wasn't a problem at all and that it took a village and wished them a fun show. I assumed he was a single parent cause no one else joined them from either side.

There was also a minor interaction where I complemented a woman's rainbow cardigan in the bathroom, if I'm being honest I had been trying to (respectfully) figure out if she was trans or not due to her size and stature (easily over 6 ft and built very sturdy, I have a lot of trans friends with the same build). Not that I have an issue with that! Being Enby myself, I just wanted to figure out how to compliment respectfully without making it to weird, as I know many are self conscious right now. Plus I was trying to figure out the fabric because it looked soft as fuck. (I think it was cotton)

I just think with all this bullshit going on right now, the best I could have done in those situations was being a good person, and a friendly neighbor to those who are different than me.",excited,wholesome
"A Moment of Pure Kindness Today, while in a cab, I stopped at a red light and witnessed something truly heartwarming in just under five minutes.

An elderly woman, likely a street vendor, stood by the roadside when a well-dressed man approached her and touched her feet as a way of paying respect in our Indian culture. That’s what caught my attention. He asked where she had been, mentioning that he had been looking for her elsewhere. Then, with genuine concern, he inquired about her well-being and whether she had everything she needed.

I then noticed that both her feet were in bandages and covered with shoes, indicating that a dressing had been done. The man gestured toward her feet and asked if she was okay, to which she reassured him that she was fine and thanked him. Before leaving, he touched her feet once again, asking for her blessings. She placed both her hands on his head and wholeheartedly blessed him.

In a world where so much is done for likes and content, this moment felt incredibly pure. No cameras, no audience—just a simple, powerful exchange of kindness and respect. It left my eyes wet for a moment because I could truly feel the warmth in it.

I don’t have any video proof, just this moment that I witnessed—and that was enough.",excited,wholesome

"Met her after Eleven years in a different city. A Reconnection in the Unexpected. Serendipity **Essence: Eleven years ago, I had a chance encounter with girl at Metro Station**. We talked for hours, a connection that felt effortless, but when the night ended, we parted without sharing names or numbers. Despite the brief encounter, she lingered in my thoughts, a bittersweet memory that I couldn’t shake. I never expected to see her again.

**Eleven Years Later: Then, today, I saw her. In a café in my hometown \[Chandigarh\]. Fate, coincidence, or something more?** I wasn’t sure, but there she was—looking as familiar as ever, yet changed, just as I had. I wasn’t the same person I was back then, and neither was she. Still, in that instant, I recognized her, and my heart raced.

She didn’t notice me at first, lost in her thoughts. But when her eyes finally met mine, confusion crossed her face, followed by recognition.

“Oh my God,” she whispered, her voice filled with disbelief.

I smiled, amused. “Took you long enough.”

We exchanged names for the first time, something we hadn’t done all those years ago. Saying them aloud felt like reclaiming something we didn’t even realize we’d lost. It was strange, yet comforting.

I offered her a brownie with chocolate ice cream, just like we shared eleven years ago. She laughed, soft and warm, like nothing had changed. “You remember?”

“How could I forget? It's the only thing we shared last time.” I replied, watching her eyes light up the same way they had that night.

We spoke for hours, the conversation flowing like we’d never been apart. She was a psychologist now, working at PGI Hospital, and I had buried myself in corporate life. But one thing hadn’t changed: the book I had always dreamed of writing, that I’d never finished. She raised an eyebrow.

“You never finished it?”

I met her gaze, feeling the weight of all that time. “Maybe I couldn’t finish it because I didn’t have my muse.”

She flushed slightly, biting her lip. She knew exactly what I meant.

She blushed, knowing exactly what I meant. We both confessed our regret from that night years ago, how we had wanted to exchange numbers but had been too shy. 

Not this time. We finally exchanged numbers, decided to connect over call and make a plan to meet soon next week.

As night began to fall, there was an unspoken understanding between us. When she stood to leave, there was a hesitation, something unspoken hanging in the air.

We walked to her car, and as the moonlight spilled over her, I realized she was even more beautiful than I remembered. 

""I guess this is me."" She said unlocking the car. She turned to me, her expression unreadable. Then, quietly, she stepped closer.

She smiled. “Isn't this your birthday month.” Before I could say anything, she leaned in and—soft as a whisper—kissed my cheek.

My breath caught. She pulled away slowly, her eyes searching mine. And then, barely above a whisper— “Happy birthday.”

I swallowed. Hard. “Thanks,” I said, my voice rougher than I intended.

I stood there, stunned, as she drove away. Astro tugged at his leash, breaking the spell. “You won’t believe how it all started,” I murmured, chuckling as we walked back home.

This time, there was no goodbye. May be a beginning.

"I never had a cat so attached to me I have 2 cats that I found, Cooper and Dotty. My family found them when they weren't kittens anymore and currently they are 5 years old. Cooper especially, is a very loner cat, he doesn't really like Dotty or my other cats that I will mention later, and he's really often just asleep.
Their older cats so they sleep a lot, Dotty is more cuddly than Cooper but still quite an independent cat. 

In October, my sister's Co-worker gave us 2 of her kittens, Lucian and Felix. We thought felix was a boy turns out she's a girl... But that's beside the point.
We got them when they were very young kittens, they looked like triangles with huge eyes and tiny fluffy bodies. Lucian loves everyone at my house he is super friendly, but he is the closest with my mum, he chose her. 
As with Felix, she's always been so close to me and as she grew, she's become so so attached that she follows me step by step. 

Sure she loves my family a lot too, but it's to the point that she walks behind me step by step meowing, not for food, but to be picked up, she starts purring, and once I put her back down she starts meowing again. I never felt this loved honestly, it feels like she's my baby and sometimes I get emotional about how affectionate she is. She let's me do anything honestly, I can rub her belly, brush her fur, place her somewhere else, she never gotten annoyed at me or anything, she never runs away from me infact she runs towards me meowing and purring.

I didn’t reach that goal, but i’m not sad because there is no stereotypical thinking! Event the 60yo+ people were thinking really openly about this and i’m shocked, i really thought that they would think really stereotypical. I have more hope for the future now, Poland is not the most tolerant country and seeing people (especially old ones) talking nicely about men in woman fields just made my day and shown me that maybe people are more open than I thought.

Thanks guys ❤️ 

Today is my birthday, and apparently my husband and best friend have planned an extravagant birthday. 

Let me back up, as many others, I was OBSESSED with twilight for years. I read all the books in the 4th grade, which probably wasn’t great for my formative years but whatever. I read them all seriously probably 100 times, Breaking Dawn probably double that. When the movies (on Redbox, god forbid my dad spend money on a family outting but whatever) came out I was already hooked. Listen I knew they were cringe, and that almost added to the hype and fun of watching them. As an adult, I’ve joined the twilight shitposting group, I’ve enjoyed every hoa hoa season I’m a full blown rat. 

My husband has always teased me about this obsession, but always came to me with odd conundrums about the twilight universe where we have discussions on the semantics of specific scenarios.

Today is my 25th birthday, and I’ve been informed I have a party planned for me tomorrow with all of my friends there. My best friend should double as an event planner because just the little details I’ve heard of are insane. There’s gonna be freaking trees, a smoke machine, and blood bags with my favorite basic cocktail (vodka cranberry’s). So much thought was put into this by my husband and best friend, and I have been on the verge of tears. 

I grew up not having birthday parties, or really celebrating my birthday so as an adult I’ve been trying to make it special to me. Last year I was going through so much postpartum emotions I was convinced none of my friends would come because I wasn’t going to be fun anymore so I planned nothing. My husband planned a day after researching going to all the book stores in the area, and even participated in picking out some books he thought I would like. 

This year, I haven’t even had my party yet and I already know he’s put so much into this. Seriously my husband is the greatest person I know, and I’m so thankful he’s gone to the lengths he has to make my birthdays special. He’s seriously amazing.

But also to have a best friend who cares so much to help him see this through, and also put so much love and care into this. 

Anyways everyone have a great day, and if you needed an excuse for a twilight marathon here it is. ❤️

"Yesterday my child was “sick” so we stayed home and it was epic Yesterday my kindergartener said they were sick and couldn’t go to school. They have never said this before so my ears perked up. My concern for their health lasted exactly 5 minutes when they didn’t have a fever and were acting exactly like themselves with no signs of illness. I decided to just say screw out and stayed home with them. I have a stressful job and didn’t get much time off during the holidays. On the weekends I do spend time with them obviously, but there’s a lot of running around doing chores and errands. So we stayed home. 

We went to the local conservation area and walked around in the forest in the snow, did groceries, played games, and snuggled all day long. Then some time in the night they woke up and came into our room and snuggled with me back to sleep in bed. The snuggles were epic. I regret nothing and I’m going to lie my ass off at work today about how they didn’t feel well. I honestly just think my child needed a chill day with Mommy.

"My stepmom gifted me my late father's lucky football jersey for my birthday.  Hi, I'm about to be 32 on Wednesday. I didn't have a relationship with my father due to my mother's side gaslighting me into thinking he was the enemy, but to be honest it was the opposite. 

My dad died while I was homeless. I was really sad about it, cancer took him. A week later his family paid for me to move across the country to a better life. Ive been doing so much better and it's due to their initial help. 

I got a package in the mail today from my stepmom and its my dad's prized, lucky Tampa Bay Buccaneers jersey. I sobbed. I hadn't seen him in person since I was six, and I know my stepmom must have thought long about this before letting it go. 

The kicker is that they got married on my birthday. My mom's side of the family held that over my head for a long time but it turns out that it was the best day in my dad's life, that's why he chose the date. 

I now have a piece of my dad with me and I no longer talk to my mom. 

This probably seems ranty and not well written, sorry about that. But I'm forever a Tampa Bay fan and I will cherish this jersey for my life. ",excited,wholesome

"Subway employee made my day I’m a new mum & today while I was doing the groceries with my little one, I caught a whiff of fresh subway cookies (IYKYK).. we’re trying to watch our money with unnecessary spending but I had some change so I asked 
‘how much for one chocolate chip cookie?’ 
‘$1.50’ he said 
So I smiled and gave him my coins. 

Then he said ‘I have some of the broken ones here I want to give you’ 

And he gave me SO MANY COOKIES. FILLED THE BAG. 😭 

Look, idk if it’s the hormones or the fact that he just did something out of the kindness of his heart - I melted.

"Watching the show Rangoli makes my Sundays even more special!  Hello! This is the first ever post I am doing on this subreddit! I am from Howrah in West Bengal in India. I am obsessed with the show Rangoli which broadcasts every Sunday on DD National at 6 pm and DD Sahyadri at 12 noon on every Sunday. Since September 12th in 2024 I have been watching the show. So for those who don't know about this show I am going to tell you about this show. Rangoli is a Musical Trivia oriented show in Hindi language which focuses on the artists and their Bollywood songs which are coupled with the anecdotes and trivias of the artists. Rangoli has been active since 1989 and it was usually broadcasted at 8 am in the morning and it currently broadcasts on 12 noon on DD Sahyadri and 6 pm on DD National on every Sunday and it is obviously done by the hosts. The best part is all the hostsesses are considered to be Bollywood's following actresses and none of the hosts are male. The first ever hostess who hosted the show is Hema Malini and there are several hosting changes, currently it is hosted by Hrishita Bhatt and I have a soft spot for music in general and I am also a music lover. So Rangoli has been positively impacting my life since the last 4 months in a very wholesome way. So it is my duty to call my mother to watch Rangoli so that we can watch it together as she also loves music so it watching Rangoli on every Sunday always makes me smile a lot! 

Yours Truly,

"It’s the little coincidences we really should enjoy. This happened recently and just has so many wonderful coincidences (my mom calls them God winks).

My neighbor had a flag case he was giving away and asked me if I wanted. I did need one for my father’s flag that I was given at his funeral in 1990. I had just never gotten one and was happy I could finally display it. It came with a little gold tag to engrave. 

I work at a machine shop and asked a machinist if they could hand engrave my father’s name and years. He said absolutely not, he would write a program and do it properly on a cnc machine so it would be perfect. Well, it did come out great.

 The inspector happened to see the tag in progress and he recognized my father’s name. This is where I remind you he’s been dead for over 30 years. My father ran a machine shop and our inspectors first job as a machinist was working for him. He adored my father, really respected him and hated when he retired in the 80s. Would have never had known he knew my dad EVER without that tag (I’m married and my name is my husband’s).

The story doesn’t end there. As a thank  you to the machinist for the tag work, I gave him a $20 scratcher lottery ticket. He won $1,000. I was so happy! I had a free case, awesome special made tag with a cool font and machinist made some money that he really needed. Plus the special connection to our inspector. And the neighbor really enjoyed hearing all the great things that transpired because he gave away a flag case.



Edit: Machinist wanted to split the lottery winnings with me but I adamantly refused.",excited,wholesome
"The Audubon Zoo in Louisiana made Hazel the opossum a mini King Cake to celebrate! 💜💚💛 They posted these photos with the caption “King cake season is officially here, and Hazel the opossum is thrilled! 💜💚💛.” 🥹 

I was having a bad day and saw these and couldn’t help but smile but couldn’t share it via link here since it was a social media post. I hope it makes one of you smile like it did for me. 

I love opossum. For many reasons beyond thinking they’re cute, btw. Opossums are nature's cleanup crew, helping control insect and rodent populations, which reduces the spread of diseases. They are also just overall highly resilient animals. They’re capable of surviving in diverse environments and even with significant injuries which speaks to their physical and mental strength I think💖 With their unique defense mechanism of ""playing dead,"" they avoid danger without aggression, contributing to a balanced ecosystem. Also they carry all their babies on their backs and it’s adorable watching a mama one waddle with them all on her like a makeshift school bus. ",excited,wholesome
"PEP customers getting heartwarming surprises - strangers are paying off their lay-bys | Business An initiative started in the #ImStaying Facebook group for South Africans back in 2020 has blossomed into the Lay-by buddy initiative. 

Parents who are in financial need or can't afford to pay off school uniforms in particular can put their clothes on lay-by and pay them off over a few months. 

These lay-by are being paid off in full by anonymous donors in South Africa so that children whose parents can't afford their uniforms can now go to school. This is a huge thing, considering how many people live in poverty in SA and live on very meagre wages.

"My recently widowed Grandma nearly peed herself laughing at her own silly joke My grandma became a widow last July, when our grandpa passed away unexpectedly. Since then, whilst she’s been happy, there’s been a little bit of her spark lost. That was, until this weekend.

Our baby cousin had us play a game where we all wrote an anonymous note, and she’d run around and hand them out to a random person in the family.

As we were all writing our notes, we notice my grandma giggling and smiling in the corner, eyeing up the whole room occasionally with a glint of childish glee in her eyes.

At one point she’s laughing so much that she has to excuse herself to the bathroom, as she thought she was going to pee her pants from laughing.

Eventually, it comes time to open the notes. My cousin (21m) is opening his note, and he sees…a drawing of a penis. 

He naturally assumes that this was the work of one of our other cousins, but as everyone denies it being them, we see our grandma laughing uncontrollably in the corner. Eventually getting out an overjoyed “it was me!” 

I don’t know how wholesome this really is given the contents of the drawing, but seeing my widower grandma get her spark back over a 12 year old boys level of toilet humour certainly felt quite wholesome. ",excited,wholesome
"The Wholesome History of Tandem Bicycles. Formerly known as “courting bikes.”  Tandem bicycles, or ""bicycles built for two,"" have such a charming, wholesome history. 

They first became popular in the 1890s, often called ""courting bikes"" because they let couples ride closely together while sharing the experience of cycling. The design has evolved since then—early tandems had the gentleman steering from the back while the lady enjoyed the ride up front (in the wind, no less!). Nowadays, they’re much more practical and balanced, but that romantic connection seems to remain the same. 

I live in America and the style depicted in these historical photographs I’ve only seen in practice once or twice in my life! I’ve seen ones low to the ground and not upright with multiple seats, though in a more modern style used by couples on trails a handful of times. 

Lately, I’ve been daydreaming about riding a tandem bicycle with my boyfriend. There’s just something so sweet about the idea of pedaling together, working in sync, and sharing a peaceful ride through a scenic trail. It feels like the perfect mix of fun, teamwork, and quality time.

Has anyone here ever ridden a tandem bike? What’s it like? Is it as lovely as it sounds, or is it one of those things that’s more romantic in theory? Do you think it’s better than riding separate bikes, or does it come with its own set of challenges?

I’d love to hear your thoughts—I’m picturing us laughing the whole time, but I have a feeling the reality might involve a few giggles, wobbles, and possible frustrations! 😅🚴‍♀️🚴‍♂️💘❓",excited,wholesome

"You really are the funniest person I know My husband and I are both sitting here playing our games. Facing away from one another. 
One of my dogs comes nosing her way into my hand so I turned and started talking to her quietly, but of course the other two dogs heard me and came running from the other room. So now all 3 are sitting and staring at me. My little one, Dolly, is a spoiled princess while my other two are bigger breeds and such good girls, like thee best. My husband takes his headphones off and asks ""whats up?"" Thinking I was trying to talk to him. 
I tell him I'm talking to the dogs about how intrusive dolly is and how it's not always about her. I go on some rant I can't remember word for word, about how dolly is like that best friend you've had your whole life who you love deeply but can be a little nervous, possibly embarrassed being in public with. ( obviously a sarcastic reference, and not word for word)
He laughs and then says "" you really are the funniest person I know"".

As a normal person, that might not seem like much. But as a deeply traumatized depressed being, having my love, my best friend, the one person I care most about in this world tell me I'm the funniest he knows and I know he means it, really made me feel so much love and greatful to have him. 
Anyways, it's silly and maybe not much, but the people who love you deeply, hold on to the words you say. Don't forget to tell them the ""little"" things because they matter more than you might think.

"My dad told me Happy new year and he has never said anything like that ever, I’m a little shocked but little me is smiling.  Hi all, just wanted to post this. I know it’s nothing big but my dad has always been distant and absent in our lives emotionally even though he’s there physically. He is very emotionally abusive and honestly never really cared for his family. As of maybe 6 years ago I’ve noticed a slight change in his behavior. For example, he was a very distant parent to my siblings and I but to my child he was so soft and gentle with him, caring, would ask me to let him hold my child and honestly they bonded a lot. Which is something I actually envied but enjoyed seeing my son and him interact. As of last year he cheated and divorced my mom and the whole family shunned him but I am an empath and I couldn’t leave him homeless (cuz obv he got kicked out) so I took him in and have been actively contacting him and talking to him to make sure he’s okay. He’s in Mexico rn. I know he did wrong, I am upset he cheated and divorced my mom because seeing her cry was hard but I also know he’s my dad and it hurts to see him be shunned away by almost all my siblings. Also, he’s been going through a crisis lately and I’m the only One who notices because no one else believes in mental health other than myself. So I reach out to him often even if it’s just to see if he’s okay. And well I am Surprised to see that he sent me a message on new years which just says “happy new years”. My dad doesn’t even say happy birthday or happy anything to anyone so for him to tell ME out of all my siblings “happy new year to everyone” is quite nice. Idk if he did it because I’m the only one that talks to him, idk if he did it because he knows I’m going through a rough time, i just know that it heals a small part of me that always wanted some form of gentleness or love from him.

"Such an amazing human being I love my GF

I recently started my new job which gave me the biggest opportunity to buy a car that was a dream the moment I saw it. It was a 2 week process of buying it because it was from another state. Everyone was supportive of my decision because they knew I was able to do it on my own. I did get the little talk from everyone, if I was sure I wanted the car because it is a little older and is a little used up but they knew I did my research. 


Anyways, the time comes where I sign the documents and its officially my car. I got the car delivered a couple days later. I get my Temp tags and I pick up my girlfriend that same day to take her out to get coffee before I go to work just as a little gesture to be one of my first passengers. A couple minutes pass by after I picked her up, and I notice she went silent. I look over to my girlfriend and I see that she's silently crying. I wanted to pull over but I had no where to go so I hold her hand and start asking her what's wrong. And she starts telling me how she's so proud of me for doing it and working hard to get my car.

"I miss my dogs right now so here are some silly little things about them. Ok. So I'm away right now and I miss my little dogs

My mom and I live together and own 5 jackrussel cross chihauhaus. They are all related. Mom(Missie) is definitely chihauhau cross Jack Russell. Dad (Snoopy) is Jack Russell cross what we think to be corgi.

Now five years ago they had puppies. Not the smartest idea and I definitely need to emphasize that if you want more dogs please please don't do this rather go to a shelter. There are so many amazing and loving dogs and cats who need a home.

The vet told us Missie would likely have 3 or 4 puppies, she's a small dog. However she had  had 7 puppies! 
I was 14 at the time and I rushed home from school so I could see the new born puppies.

We managed to get good homes for most of the puppies but kept 3 of them as my mom only wanted to give puppies to the people she trusted. So eventually the 3 left became part of our family

First of all there's Boris 
He's my absolute world. I shouldn't have favourites I know! Between my mom and I who are absolutely crazy for dogs there is more than enough love to go around. I can't explain how much this dog has helped me with my mental heath through my teen years either.
One of the strange things he does is jump onto my back. You would swear Boris thinks he is a mountain goat. I'll often lean down in the kitchen to find stuff in the lower cabinets and as soon as I do he will jump onto my back and put he's paws over my shoulder like a parrot. Sometimes I'll even end up walking around slightly hunched over because my dog is laying on my back like he's a prince. He's a very strange looking dog too. He looks a little like an alien, a very cute alien. 

Now we just got this new recliner couch which Boris seems to think belongs to him and will get pretty pissed when either my mom or I come to sit on the couch. I've never had a dog judge me so hard for taking his spot lmao.

There is also Todi

When the puppies were born Todi had a half black and white face straight down the middle of his snout. So as an anime crazy pre teen I was extatic and he got nicknamed todoroki which eventually just stuck.
He is a very fat dog! And I plan on taking him for some more walks to make sure he stays fit. Todi is a very quiet dog typically but he is also definitely the leader of the pack. He kinda pushes the other dogs around with his weight and ends up being the play toy when the other dogs play fight. It's really cute, he kinda just stands there like an older brother not bothered by the other dogs wrestling him. He's also chunky enough to sit on his but and stand up like a meerkat for tummy tickles. I'll  often wake up to a belly in my face so I can give him tickles. He also always has a sly awkward look on his face. Very silly and cute honestly. Like what did you do boy?! 

Snoopy( the dad)

Was the first dog we got. He definitely has turned more into a grumpy father though. But he's a puppy at heart. Sometimes I'll close my bedroom door and jump around my bed patting my hands on the sheet and snoop will play with me growling and jumping to where I've patted my hands down. I think it's important that he gets some one on one time.
He's also such a sweetie and will wait for his kids to finish eating before he eats any of the food from the dog bowl. ( we have tried to give them all separate bowls but they all steal from eachother. Any advice on this would be so appreciated btw)

Anyways this is just a post about some of the small silly things my dogs do. Miss them a ton right now and I can't even begin to explain these silly creatures behavior. Between all 5 of them they all have their own characters which I'm sure any pet owner can understand, if they own multiple of the same species. It's absolutely amazing and adorable seeing all of your dogs personalities grow through.

My mom and I love our little critters to bits although they are naughty and not very well trained (fully on us for that) they are like little baby's to us and we cherish them so much.
The house I'm in feels a little empty without them.

Also if you have any of your own stories like this I would absolutely love to read them in the comments.

I'll post a couple pictures of my little critters in the comments.

"Waitress ""forgot"" to add expensive drink to my tab, so I tipped her extra I went out for lunch and drinks today. My waitress was wonderful all around, but when I got the bill, it was significantly less than I expected. Drinks around here are like $8-12. Anything above that is either expensive or a double. My meal was maybe $18, and I ordered 2 drinks - 1 ""normal"" and 1 ""expensive"". When the bill came, my total was only $31 when I expected $40+. I was confused until I looked at the itemized list. She didn't add the expensive drink, which was $14.

I pointed this out and she just said ""Merry Christmas"". I had already tipped her well (like 66%), but I was a hair short of tipping the enture amount of the bill because I wasn't letting her get away with that without a bonus.",excited,wholesome
"Birthday love My father had a massive stroke and died on my 25th birthday. Years later I let my new boyfriend know that I didn't celebrate my birthday because of all the sad feelings and memories tied to it. He was very understanding and never pushed me to celebrate until years later when he showed up at my house with a wrapped gift. I was surprised but went ahead and opened it. It was an engagement ring. He told me he wanted to propose on my birthday so I would have a good memory to think about every year instead of just a sad one.

"I love my boyfriend so much  He’s genuinely so sweet. I’ve never met a guy that’s as caring and considerate as him. I have some significant mental health issues, and this man has put up with it and supported me through them, even when I would be crying on the floor because I didn’t want to live anymore. I genuinely don’t have the words to describe how appreciative of him I truly am.
Not only that, but he’s just the cutest ever. He’s really nerdy, and loves computers. He built this super cool, super powerful but compact pc, and has a collection of retro electronics that he fixed up. When he’s yapping about CPUS and soldering and whatnot, even though I have no idea what he’s talking about, I love hearing what he has to say. It just makes him so happy, and that makes me happy.
That also applies for his absolute love for cats. He ADORES cats. He has 3, and the voice he gets talking to them, and the excitement and pride in his voice when talking about them brings so much joy in my heart.
During spicy time, he also considers my needs as well as his own, which is new to me, and it makes me feel incredibly cared for. He loves the parts of my body that I’m self conscious about. He makes me feel pretty.
Im just so thankful for him.",excited,wholesome

"My son said, ""Bye, Granddad,"" and it was the sweetest thing ever. My (39, f) dad was an wonderful and amazing man who unfortunately passed away from cancer in 2008. He never got to see either of his children graduate from high school or college. (It was brain cancer and had messed with his memory. He was diagnosed four days after I graduated from high school, but didn't realize he had missed it until two weeks later.) He never got to see us get married. He never got to meet his grandkids.

I no longer live in my hometown, but whenever I visit I make it a point to stop by his grave as I'm heading out of town. This tradition continued after I married my husband (37, m), as well as after the birth of our son (8, m). It started out with me standing out there alone, but they started joining me three years ago.

We're heading home today. My son asked, ""What should I call your dad?"" We've been referring to him as Grandpa FirstName, but it was clear my son wanted to give him another name, so I asked him what he wanted to use. ""I wanna call him 'Granddad!"" he said. I told him, ""I think he (Dad) would love that.""

We get to Dad's gravesite. I spent a few minutes talking to Dad. I told him my son was still a sweet boy making good grades at school. I said if he had anything to do with me meeting my husband, then I thanked him for sending me the most wonderful man ever. I then said, ""Well, it's cold out here and Son needs some food in his belly, so we're gonna head out. I love you, Dad.""

My son causally adds, ""Bye, Granddad!"" before heading to the car.

Instantly, my face gets buried in my husband's chest as I balled. He said it like Granddad was still alive and we were leaving his house. He said it like he had known Granddad his whole life and not only through stories. Neither my husband nor I had expected it and it had us both in tears.

I know my dad would have absolutely loved my son. Now, I have confirmation he would have loved him back and it's the sweetest feeling in the world",excited,wholesome

"I helped a customer by paying a vending machine I work at a Homegoods as a part time and while I was getting a coke zero from the pickup line for my break (we didn’t have one in the break room) when this lady asked me to grab a regular soda from the cooler in the queue line. The thing is, it was out of regular soda.

I then had a crazy idea.

So I rushed over to the break room, bought a regular soda from the vending machine for two bucks, then rushed back to the cashier as the lady was going to pay. She was very surprised and happy, and I only asked she paid me back in 2 dollars to compensate my money. 

She gave me three dollars in return. 💖",excited,wholesome
"How Dad helped me believe in Santa a little longer. About the time I turned eight years old, I was beginning to doubt the existence of Santa Claus. I was a precocious child as it was, so the math wasn't mathing when it came to the jolly old elf. But I wasn't completely willing to let go of my belief yet.

Early in December of 1996, my dad's childhood best friend was getting remarried and invited my dad to be a groomsman. So we would be out of town until the very night of Christmas Eve. I wanted a swing set for Christmas that year (we lived in Florida, so it would definitely see immediate use), but had been told I'd just have to ask Santa for it.

Well, that dashed my hopes, especially since by that point of the year I was almost sure of Santa's unreal status. When we got home Christmas Eve, I had resigned myself to that fact, and just hoped maybe I'd get one next year.

Well, on Christmas morn, when my sister and I had finished unwrapping presents, my dad looked outside and said, ""Hey, what's that out there?"" I looked and what to my surprise did I see? A fully assembled swing set, ready for play.

""He's real!"" I shouted for joy! How else could a fully assembled swing set just appear when Dad wasn't around to do it himself? It had to be Santa!

By age nine I had figured out that Dad bought the swing set and had a friend set it up while we were away (though I didn't learn which one until my teens). But that's not why I'm posting this story. I'm posting this story because this is what Christmas is supposed to be about: making memories with your family more precious than any earthly possession. I consider myself very blessed to have such a wonderful father in my life.",excited,wholesome
"The year Christmas was ruined... 2017, post Hurricane Harvey in South Texas. We lived in a house on pilings, so we were super lucky to not have flooding in our house, though we had about 4 feet of water in the storage room under the house. By the time the water and probably sewage (after 5 days of 90 degree heat, fun) drained out, everything in the room was a total loss. Guess where we stored our Christmas decorations. 

My husband and I's work were closed for a week and we had just spent all our money on hurricane supplies. We tried our hardest to work extra hours but, face it, in an area where a LOT of people had water up to their roof and lost EVERYTHING, they didn't have money to go out to eat. (We waited tables).

There was barely enough to make rent. We had nothing to give the kids and no tree or stockings to give it in, even if we did. I cried so much that year. I felt like a failure. 

Then the miraculous happened. 

My coworkers pitched in and got us a real tree, ornaments, and lights. The Lion's Club brought a box of food for Christmas dinner and donated gifts for the kiddos.

Y'all, to say I was worried the kids would be ungrateful, would be an understatement. They'd been spoiled every year, getting exactly what they put on their wish list and, well, kids are kids.

They were SO ECSTATIC for their little box of dollar store gifts. They hugged each of the volunteers that delivered them and said thank you. They played for HOURS together with their little toys while the husband and I made our donated dinner. Then we sat around the table talking about the cool things they got and all the stories they made up with them. It ended up being one of the best Christmases ever!

Even if you feel this may be the worst Christmas and you're not giving enough, the kids just want YOU. They aren't going to remember all the toys they got, but they will remember the experiences. Merry Christmas! ❤",excited,wholesome

"Remembered something wholesome which happened on a trip When I was around 11 years old, I remember going on a trip to Greece (I believe it was Santorini) with my parents and another family. The eldest daughter of the family and I were allowed to explore while the adults caught up on life. 

We were walking along this path and there were two girls-- clearly younger than us-- and I smiled at the older one. The four of us didn't have a common language, so we stood around for a little bit speaking with exaggerated gestures and images drawn on the ground. 

Suddenly, the younger girl points to something and starts talking and gesturing. Friend and I didn't understand, so the girls grab our hands and pull us towards this cardboard box on the ground. 

When I look inside, there is a big mother cat with black fur, and her kittens were snuggled up to her. There must've been around 6 kittens, and they were *tiny*! I look at the girls and gesture 'can I pet?' and make sure the mother cat is familiar with me before gently patting this kitten with white paws. After a while, the eldest girl picks up the sleepy kitten and places it in my arms and it had the softest fur I'd ever felt in my whole life. For the next few hours, we spent the time watching the cats and playing with them until friend and I had to go.

I never saw those girls again, but that moment on the trip is one I'll remember forever ❤️ ",excited,wholesome
"I realized today that I made a difference in someone’s life  I generally try to be a nice person and make peoples days better when I can. I think everyone can benefit from random kindness as you never know what someone is going through or if they are having a bad day.

I had my last day at a cafe I barista at and one of my regulars who I love serving, unexpectedly, gave me a card and a small gift as a going away gift. 

Part of the card read “you always made me feel special” 

Like I said, I loved serving this regular. I tried to make sure I made her drink so I could make sure she was getting good quality and I would always hand deliver it to her instead of having her come up to the counter. 

Purely because she was such a sweet women (some people just have that demeanor if you know what I mean) and she would be reading her book after ordering so why would I want her to have to stop and get up to grab a drink.

I had no idea it actually made a difference in her day, and I’ve never had someone say something that has hit so deeply with her as that sentence. 

I never realized I may actually make a difference in anyone’s life (beyond the given of my immediate family or significant others) and honestly it’s making me extremely emotional and I don’t know what to do with these feelings so I’m making this post. 

EDIT (12/24) : thank you all for the sweet comments and awards!  I wasn’t expecting this to get as much attention as it did 😊😊 hope you all have a great holiday season!!

"The moment my grandmother reunited with her brother after 50 years apart. (1999) After WWII in 1949 the country of Indonesia (a Dutch colony at the time) gained their independence from the Netherlands. 

My family is of mixed European and Asian descent and were Dutch citizens. The Indonesian government required all Dutch citizens to renounce their citizenship and become Indonesian citizens if they wanted to stay. Many chose to leave to their “mother” country, the Netherlands, or to Australia, or the United States. 

My grandmother’s only surviving immediate family, one younger brother and her mother, left for Australia. At the time Australia’s strict immigration laws only allowed for white or white-passing people to enter. My grandmother’s family were fair skinned and had lighter hair. My grandmother did not. 

My grandmother stayed in Indonesia, got married, left for the Netherlands in 1960 when Dutch citizens could no longer postpone renouncing their citizenship, had 10 kids, and lived a quiet and humble life. 

My grandparents didn’t travel much, what with the ten kids and all, and her brother never had the means to visit either. 

For my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary, the ten kids chipped in and bought her brother and his wife tickets to surprise my grandmother.

"Fiancée helped me find New Hobbies! I (24F) have been dating my fiancée (24M) for just over 4 years now. Before him, I had no hobbies. I always just threw myself into my work, schooling or whatever tasks I had. Outside of that, nothing that brought me joy or fulfillment. 
When we first started dating, I noticed he had a lot of interests. These ranged all the way from metrovania games, tcg card games, all the way to things like transformers and dark souls lore. At first I was so disinterested, until one day I asked a question about something (I can’t even remember what it was about, but I remember how big the smile was on his face was) He and I are both neurodivergent, and I could tell having a place to talk about his interests really boosted his mood, so I decided to try to be more present when he talked about things he enjoyed.

Not too long after that, a mutual friend introduced him to Gunpla model kits. I was intrigued because I always enjoyed things like legos, or other “building” toys and such. After seeing him build one or two, I went with him to the local hobby shop where he purchased them.
That same day I saw a unicorn gudam high grade build kit (IYKYK) and although he knew what I was in for, he bought it and we built kits together for the first time. This would become a regular occurrence in our household. To date, together combined we have over 30 kits built (We shared a fixation for a few months) and I’m even delving into custom painting my kits.

Next, the same mutual friend and his girlfriend invited us to play a game of commander. I had never touched magic cards before, and he had limited knowledge and experience as well. Turns out, we both loved it, and now we play 2 player commander games against each other all the time. (Except when he plays eldrazi. Fuck eldrazi) 
And now I am building my own decks and coming up with combos. Moth man currently being my next deck to upgrade. 

Outside of other things he has introduced me to, he has opened a world for me of exploration into arts, literature, media and entertainment. I grew up with the mentality that if I wasn’t good at it, or if I didn’t keep up with it for a considerable amount of time, it’s not worth it to try. Now he has helped me form positive outlooks at exploring my interests. If I pick it up just to put it down, it was still worth the try. Because of this, I have made artwork I would have never felt I was capable of making, I have explored more music genres and even started writing my own songs. I have enjoyed reading lore and playing new video games. 

I had a million reasons to fall in love with him already, but I have really noticed the positive impact he has had on my creativity and my expression. I am so glad to have him. 

My newest endeavor? Trying to crochet. Let’s hope for the best!

"A story of step in-laws This is a story from over 15 years ago, but it has always been close to my heart.

Just the background: I married a Japanese woman when I lived in Japan a million years ago. We had three children, and in the middle of doing that, we moved back to the U.S.  I had a great relationship with my in-laws, my father in law especially, and they came and visited us a couple of times in the U.S.  We went to Japan quite a few times, also.  We would send them videos of the kids, and they sent us videos of Japanese TV kids shows.  We also talked a lot on the phone.  My kids were their only grandchildren.

My wife passed away when our oldest was 13.  Her parents came for the funeral, and a few months later I took the kids to visit them by myself.

I remarried a year and a half later.  My second wife is also Japanese.  Her father passed away when she was young.  Her mom did not like the idea of her daughter marrying me, but she gave us her blessing when she saw that it was going to happen anyways.  Her mother has been pleasant to me and my children ever since.

About six months into our marriage, we went to Japan for a few weeks, and we spent about five days travelling with my first wife's parents.  This was all planned and instigated by my wife, who wanted to give them a chance to spend some time with their grandchildren.

That being said, my wife found it difficult on some level because my in-laws were strangers to her, not her family, and Japanese culture being what it is she felt a lot of pressure to be polite and considerate in a formal way on this ""family vacation"", but my father-in-law especially has a very gentle, friendly nature, so that at least by the end of this time together she felt more comfortable and at ease with him. 

Fast forward a couple more years, and we reach the really wholesome part of the story.

My wife and I were expecting a child.  Since this was her first child, she wanted to be with her mother during the baby's first few months, in order to learn the ropes.  Since she would have to go back at least a month before her scheduled delivery date (I remember that we had to get a note from her obstetrician clearing her to fly because she was almost eight months along at that point), we planned for her to be gone for three months.

As much as I wanted to be with her during the last month of pregnancy and the first couple of months of my newborn daughter's life, it would not be practical for us all to go live in Japan for three months.  It was in the middle of the school year, and for the five of us to pile into my second wife's mother's two bedroom house (where she lived with her oldest daughter) would be a bit much, especially adding a newborn into the party after a month or so.

But my wife did see an opportunity to do something special with my youngest son, who was 11 at this time.  Her mom lives in a rural city in Northern Japan, and so she knows several people who were schoolmates of hers decades ago who now were in positions in local government and education, and so my wife asked her to see if it was possible to pull some strings and let our youngest son attend the local elementary school for a few months, just as a special experience.  It was possible, the school would be very excited to have him, and so in the end, the plan was that she and my youngest would go to Japan and live with her mother for three months during the last month of her pregnancy and a couple of months after the birth.

At some point we mentioned this to my first wife's father during one of our phone calls, and he was very concerned about my current wife's safety and health, travelling on a long international flight, and then having to make a long trip to her hometown in Japan, all while being eight months pregnant and watching over an 11 year old who did not speak much Japanese, and with luggage to wrangle as well.

(My wife is an experienced traveler and was a great stepmom, and Japan has convenient luggage delivery services, so she was not overly concerned about the difficulties of this trip, or she wouldn't have made the plans that she did.)

So this 80 year old man volunteered to meet my wife and son at the airport in order to escort them to her mom's house.

He lived a couple hours west of Tokyo, so this meant that he would basically have to take a three day trip to do this.  A three hour journey to Narita to await the late afternoon arrival of my wife and son (and you can be sure that he got there earlier than necessary, just to make sure that he would be there when they arrived), then spend the night at a Tokyo area hotel, and then a six hour train trip to my wife's hometown in northern Japan, spend the night at my wife's mom's house (while we were planning this all out, he said, ""don't worry about me, she can just clear out a space under the stairs for me to sleep, I'll be fine""...like I said, he had a very gentle and friendly nature), and then travel all of the way back to his home the next day.

Well, I wasn't there, but apparently everyone got along swimmingly.  My wife and her mother did appreciate what he did, and he was (not surprisingly) a very pleasant and polite guest.  Japanese do not frequently have overnight non-family guests in their homes (and my first wife's father and my second wife's mother were complete strangers to each other), as the houses tend to be small and it does place an unspoken burden of politeness in close quarters that people do not undertake lightly.  But he and my ""second"" mother-in-law went above and beyond to be considerate towards each other.

He and his wife lived for about ten more years after this.  During that time, they and my second wife's mother would send each other the typical gifts that Japanese send to family, and call each other a couple of times a year on the phone, especially if one or the other's family member was sick or had passed away, etc.  And of course both sides would send all four of my kids gifts at Christmas, making no distinction between grandchildren vs. ""step-grandchildren.""

Blended families can be fraught with difficulty, and I always felt so lucky that my wife and all of my in-laws chose to do their best to be pleasant and thoughtful towards each other for our sakes and our childrens' sakes.",excited,wholesome

Ended up having two beautiful little boys (my amazing nephews) with him and even bought herself her own car!! Just yesterday she surprised everyone by announcing the home she just bought as well! It's a darling apartment with a lovely view and she's already filling it up with furniture and toys for the boys!! She's nervous about her new start in life and all I can see is her amazing success, she has no idea how strong she is and how incredible she's become.

"How did I get so lucky? I (22F) have been in a relationship with my partner since 2021, and I can honestly say that our journey together has been nothing short of extraordinary. There is no way I could ever feel more blessed than I do with him by my side. We met on a random street in a bustling market, almost straight out of a romantic novel, and from that moment on, my life has been forever changed.

In a world where suffering often feels like it’s lurking at every corner, he has this incredible ability to make even my biggest worries feel small. He is the kind of person who makes you fall in love with him every single day. His beautiful brown eyes are the light of my life, I pray for him and I write to him in places he doesn’t even know about—yet. His kindness, empathy, and warmth are the only things I seem to think about these days.

Don’t get me wrong, every person in love feels this way—but today, in this random Reddit space, I just want to count my most divine blessing. This post has no real beginning or end, but simply serves as a reminder to cherish the one you love the most. There is no greater blessing in life than being loved and in love, no matter what the future holds.

TLDR ; Count your blessings fellas, life is truly magical. Love your loved ones a little extra today - and everyday.",excited,wholesome
"Who does this? My wife, that's who. I originally posted this on r/relationshipgoals, but was advised to share here. Please remove post if not allowed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hi, I'm kind of new to reddit, so not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I just needed to brag about my wife somewhere. Apologies for the long post.

So fairly recently I got back into reading after a long dry spell and I had no idea where to start. The previous Christmas I had gotten my wife a Kindle though, so she fortunately had plenty of recommendations for me. Well, I say fortunately, but she was (and is) mostly reading things like ACOTAR, which really isn't my cup of tea. Nevertheless, I finished them so she could vent to me about Tamlin and whatnot, and that seemed to make her really happy.

Still not sure what I was looking for, I decided to follow her recommendation one more time and read something she described as ""light-hearted, sarcastic comedy in a fairytale world"", which sounded great. Yup, she got me again, romance and smut galore. The non-romantic stuff, however, actually matched her description and I had a great time reading it. Not only that, but it really inspired me.

I wrote a couple of books in our native language during my late teens/early twenties, but to be fair they were quite generic and only about 300 pages long. I still like them, but they're not the most original works. Reading these comedy books recommended by my wife opened my eyes though. I don't have to write ""properly"" and in a serious tone? I can make my main character kind of a sarcastic asshole and make stupid references, etc? I can write in English, just 'cause I think their words for stuff sound cooler?

Long story short, I wrote a book. It took me the better part of a year and there was a lot of proofreading and editing at the end. My wife, amazing as she is, cheered me on along the way and helped in whatever ways she could. She also encouraged me to release the book in Amazon Bookstore for next to nothing, just so that friends, family, and maybe the occassional could get to read it too.

When the time came to release it, however, my wife was starting to act kind of distant about the whole thing. I suggested we celebrate the occasion somehow (which we usually like to do, even for smaller things), but only got non-committal responses. I didn't think much of it, but then suddenly, some time later (but still before the date of publication) my wife came around and agreed that we should do something as a small celebration, like go to a slightly fancier restaurant and order some champagne.

The evening arrived and as we arrived in the ""restaurant district"" of our city, my wife started leading me towards a place I'd never even noticed before. I was slightly surprised, but figured she had heard about it from a friend or something and wanted to try it out. Boy had I been underestimating her.

As we entered, I was met with cheers, golden banners, music, people dressed in suits and nice dresses, and champagne galore. As it turns out, for the last couple of months, my wife had been organizing a book release party for me, complete with custom merch, a signing station with laminated pictures of my book cover (since the book was digital only) and a freaking journalist from the local paper to interview me.

It was the sweetest, most thoughtful thing I had ever experienced. I'm a bit of an introvert, but I went around, hugging everyone and smiling like a fool the whole time. It was truly amazing and I still can't believe she did all that for me, I'm so lucky to have her and every day I try to make sure she knows that.",excited,wholesome

"The limping stray dog At night, whenever I would go to take out the trash alone, I would make it a point to pay a visit to the temple in my society because, for some reason, praying at night when no one’s watching me appeals to me more. On my way back, I used to make it a point to pet this dog whom I only see at night. This one limps and made it a regular thing when I started petting it. Then, bro discovered where I stay, noticed the trash outside my gate, and took it as an invitation to play with it. He trampled all over the trash and tore the bag (I couldn’t care less).

Now, this got on my roommate’s nerves, who wondered which animal was messing with the trash because this house is a haven for animals—unbeknownst to him that I would encourage it, lmao. Now, this one doesn’t even bother eating anything I give him. Bread? Doesn’t care. Roti? Can suddenly use his fourth leg and run away. All he wants is to trample the eggshells in the garbage bag. And now, he has started waiting outside my gate for me to take the trash out.

I’ve started keeping a separate trash bag for him to play with, but no—doesn’t give a shit. Tonight, as I walked back from the temple, I saw him sitting there, his shadow waiting patiently for me. And in that moment, I realized that my whispered prayers, my stolen seconds of solitude, and even my scattered trash all pointed to one simple truth: at night, whenever I would go to take out the trash, I wasn’t alone.",excited,wholesome
"Supportive Partner I have posted before about my partner, I gave him flowers and he reacted in the cutest way.

This is an appreciation post for him.
We have only been together a short time, our first date was at the beginning of March this year. 

For the last 10 years I've been adamant that I was not going to have kids, I was on contraception but still got pregnant. When I showed my partner the pregnancy test we had already been planning on him moving in that weekend. The second I saw that test I knew I couldn't get rid on it. And when I told my partner that I wanted to keep it. He immediately switched from ""what do we do?"" To being supportive and saying ""what do you need from me to make this easier on you?"" 

Since then he has been so excited, he picks up vitamins for, comes to appointments, gets me food or drinks. Has been standing up to his family for me when they've tried to push my boundaries etc.

He has stepped up more than I could have ever imagined, and he just really deserves this shout out, he is an amazing man and I'm glad that at least my life's plan changing is with him. ",excited,wholesome
"I remember when it was my birthday but we couldn't celebrate it I was tuning 13 and we couldn't celebrate my birthday due to my dads job (he basically buys houses and fixes them and sells them) My family (mom, dad, older sister, me, little brother, younger brother) went to the house with my cousins family (aunt, uncle, S, sarah, P, and L) and we were staying for theee days. 

So basically on day like 2 or 3 it was the night of my birthday and (there were three rooms and the parents slept in one room while the boys and the girls slept in different rooms) I was on my phone on the mattress with my sara and sister and feeling kinda disappointed about not celebrating my birthday. And i counted down the minutes. 11:57, 11:58, 11:59, and YAY 12:00!! It was June 7 and I was 13. 

My cousin went to youtube and played a song, i was about to shush her but i hear the music. The guys busted in the room (S, my brother V and I think P) and they started giggling and laughing while sara was trying to shush them and was like ""Guys your ruining the moment"" Sara then started the song and they all started singing ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to yOoOuUu, happy biiiRthday to alan (my name) Happy birthday to youuu"" And i was so touched and happy. 

I was touched and I felt so happy. They planned this and idk why but when people include in stuff like this I feel so so happy words can't describe how happy i am. I love my cousins and family. I'm posting this because my sisters birthday is in 2 hours and she's turning 15, she says that she's ""Halfway there to 30"" which makes her sound so old.

Im not rlly deprived of compliments or anything. It's just that whenever I do recieve them, it's usually directed towards what im wearing(ex. ""Your dress looks pretty"" ""Your bow looks cute"") So being told that I look pretty and not my bow kinda hits different

"My boyfriend's smell is stuck on me I’m not sure how to explain this to him, but his scent is incredibly nice and soothing. He literally smells like sugar with a hint of something slightly tangy. When I sniff him, it feels warm and comforting, with a masculine touch that’s hard to describe but impossible to forget.

*If he was a scenery, I'd say he would give me the feeling of waking up around 6 AM to the soft sprinkle of rain in the mountains with a soothing blue-gray hue on the cold, yet comfortably warm enough to keep goosebumps at bay. The view is breathtaking, with his scent lingering gently throughout the room.*

We recently went out today since 9am till 4pm... and his smell was stuck to me cause I keep on shoving myself to hug his arms around.. The shirt I wore is covered with his smell and I have honestly.... been sniffing on it for more than 3hours straight untill I fell asleep. and I woke up sniffing it again... Not sure if this is normal?

Now I'm contemplating if I should wash this shirt or no.

After 15 years with the disease I was at the end stages of liver failure and was placed on the transplant list as of February this year.

"Toddler Randomly Adopts My Mom at a Rest Stop On our way home from a lil road trip today, my family and I stopped at a service station to stretch and take a break. While my mom and I were waiting for my dad near the entrance, she noticed this adorable toddler (maybe 1–2 years old) and gave a little wave and said hi.

This kid was so cute—big eyes, total lack of self-preservation lmao- and out of nowhere, she just runs at my mom with her arms up like she’s known her forever. My mom instinctively picks her up and checks with her parents and they’re just like, “I think it’s ok, it looks like she loves you!” Meanwhile, this tiny koala of a child clings to my mom and gives her this little nod like, yeah, you’re my person now.

It was the most unexpectedly wholesome thing. My mom was so touched—it’s amazing how a moment of pure, innocent connection like that can make you feel so appreciated.

It was a rough first month, especially given that Jiraiya is twice the size of Kyo, and the boys having territory issues. 5 months later, they play several times a day, and it's brought some energy out of my 9yo old man. Hes even lost a little weight, like the vet wanted. And starting a few weeks ago, they've started cuddling and napping with each other occasionally.

"Paying kindness forward Two years ago, my sister and mother were in a car accident that almost cost them their lives. It was bad, the entire car was crushed and in blazes. Since then, even though they both lived and have recovered for the most part, I have found it hard to be thankful or in the Christmas spirit. But this year as I was buying some turkeys to give to my church's turkey drive for the food bank, I overheard a stressed out mom, with her five or six yr old son, complaining about some dead beat dad and that she couldn't afford a few microwave meals to feed them until payday.  
I turned around and I paid it for them and handed them a $20 for whatever they needed and asked why the son only had on ripped jeans and an old T shirt with the cold weather. The mom admitted that she couldn't afford to get either of them anything warm to wear.

So, me being the over prepared Boy Scout I am for campouts and also lazy for not taking my pack out of the car yet, I had a few extra jackets and all that in the car. So I asked if they would like to follow me out and see if any of it fits them. The mom said she couldn't ask me to do that but I said that if my mom heard of that and I didn't do whatever I could for them, I would never hear the end of her anger.  
So they came out to the car and I gave them a few things to keep them warm.

She insisted that she couldn't take it from me and not pay me back so I told them the story of two years ago and how when I needed it most, I had one single person there for me and it was time I paid it forward and the best way to pay me back was, once able to, pay it forward themselves. 

It is safe to say that I can now see a reason to be thankful for everything this year and I just hope that I can make a difference in more people's lives like I was maybe able to do for them.",excited,wholesome
"My Walmart Angel First off, I usually hate my local Walmart as I had a creepy door greeter incident BUT I had the most wholesome thing happen to me yesterday that’s it’s almost completely changed my perspective. 

My grandpa passed almost 5 years ago today, and when I think of Christmas I think of him. Growing up when we would come visit absolutely EVERY Christmas movie that played on the hallmark channel he would have recorded and paid for extra storage so he could have hundreds of recordings. He would keep the magic of Christmas alive even into our teen years, and made what was a bad home life for us growing up better when we could come visit him and my grandma. He would walk Walmart to help him lose a little bit of weight, and he would pick out things he thought we would like. One year he got everyone a pack of 10 of those tiny flashlights and so my cousins, my siblings and I all played flashlight tag when it got darker. They were always out of the box things. He was a larger man with a bigger belly, and starting in October would grow his beard out as long as possible to resemble Santa. Even as we got older it was one of my favorite things. 

Now in my adulthood, I’m maybe healing a bit of my inner child by going above and beyond for Christmas. My oldest and I always decorate the tree together, (my youngest is only a little over a year), my husband son and I do Christmas crafts, and I thrift excessively for Christmas village homes and nostalgic style Christmas decorations/ornaments. 

One could say I’m a bit obsessed. Anyways, the other day for the first time I was able to buy for a kid off the angel tree so my mom and I walked almost every aisle of Walmart to buy for two teens, one me and one her. (They were twins we couldn’t not buy for both.) I went down the Christmas aisles as we were nearing the end and noticed a few different Santa statues that were out of the ordinary Christmas traditional Santa’s. There were probably 5 or 6 different styles. I came across one that brought actual tears to my eyes, because I swear to you it looked JUST like my grandpa. He had a fishing pole, a fishing hat, and had a red flannel with of course the long Santa beard.

I did NOT get it right then but seriously regretted that. I told my mom I would come back for that as soon as the Christmas holiday was over so I could get it marked down (I grew up in extreme poverty so I find it hard to buy things full price). I slept on it and decided I would just go and get it full price the next day after not being able to sleep about this unorthodox Santa. 
I go back the next day and before even walking to the Christmas stuff I browse the clearance aisle. I get to the very end and there he was marked 50% off. The only one, out of 6 was this specific Santa. I don’t know if he was a return as this was the only one or if one of the many employees marked him down but It brought actual tears to my eyes. So everyone here is my “grandpa” ",excited,wholesome

"After several abusive and toxic relationships and never getting unconditional love from my family, this man I've fallen head over heels for has fallen for me. I took my boyfriend on a vacation as one of my birthday gifts to him. We haven't been together 6 months yet, but we got really close really fast and clicked immediately. He's truly the most incredible person in so many walks of life. 

On our trip, he received a message from an ex asking for him back and he immediately told me about it and made it very clear to me that he was not interested. He told me he told her about me the week we had our first date and that he didn't want to talk to her again. He then told me that he knows I'm the one he wants. 

The last night of our trip, I opened up about the insecurity I was feeling over the message regardless of how wonderfully he handled the situation. I told him I often resort to trying to be the smartest person in the room when I'm insecure. He told me he loves when I share information and that I'm so smart but that's not why he wants to be with me. 

I turned and looked at him and said ""I love you."" And without skipping a beat, he smiled and said it right back. He told me he was planning on telling me first on this trip but he couldn't get the timing right. 

I've never felt so loved and full. Any issue we have has is met with strong communication and it's always us vs the problem, never us vs each other. 

After 5 nights and 5 days together in another state, together the entire time without space, we get home and he tells me he can't wait to see me Saturday and then says ""I'll let you know when I get home. I love you."" 

He texted me this when he got back which is the first time anyone has ever texted that to me and meant it. 

This morning, I had sent his family access to our vacation album and he told me he added all but one photo to the shared album. He sent me the photo and said he wanted us to both have it. I didn't even knew he took it but he sent me a photo of us kissing in a mirror reflection. 

I'm so in love and so happy. It's always felt very unconditional and he'll tell me he feels the same. He's taking me home for Christmas, his favorite holiday, for me to meet the rest of the family and his friends. I can't stop smiling today. ",excited,wholesome

"Elderly Husband Recreates Teacher's Love From Her Students My mom taught elementary school in our local neighborhood for over 25 years. On the day before Christmas break, she would come home with armloads of gifts. As a young child, she always let me sort through all the treasures and I greatly admired all the love given to my mom. There were baked goods, handwritten notes, coffee mugs, and much more.  The year she retired in the early 80's, she jokingly mentioned to my dad that she would miss that.  My dad went and bought 28 little gifts, wrapped each one separately, and presented them to my mom. Of course, she was once again overwhelmed with love for one final time. ",excited,wholesome
"It's been a year since my father passed away. I try to incorporate some of his old things into my life, so I have constant reminders of him. Recently, I decided to start using his wallet as my own. While emptying it, I found the receipt from the time he bought me my first beer, many years ago. He passed away after a long, hard fought battle with cancer. My father wasn’t the most affectionate, but he was still a great dad. He didn’t often vocalize his love, but it was clear that it was there. No matter how bad things got or how awful he felt, you’d never know it from the way he carried himself. His positivity was infectious, and he made a lasting impact on many people’s lives. Knowing that he kept this little memento with him every day was exactly the reminder I needed. My father really did care about me.",excited,wholesome
"My cousins are incredibly sweet  

My cousins are very sweet and probably some of the most important people in my life. They’re both kids (9F) and I’ve just become an adult. I usually do my best to play with and take care of them and one of them (who says I’m her favourite) said that she liked that I have the most patience out of all of her cousins (I wasn’t sure whether I did or not so that was a nice opinion to find out.)

The other day, she got upset about not being able to listen in on a conversation between me and my other cousin (she’s three years younger than me so closer to me in age than them) as it wasn’t exactly a conversation for kids to hear.

Later she threw a tantrum and despite being a really sweet kid, can get a bit hard to handle when she’s angry (which isn’t often but still happens.)

She was stomping up the stairs, then came downstairs and yelled and screamed every few moments and would make remarks meant to be mean to me and my cousin. Purposefully bump into us etc etc. whilst we were remaining calm with her and trying not to react to that whilst trying to comfort her at the same time. 

She wasn’t listening though and started to get pretty rude and then told my aunt and we all sat down whilst I explained what had happened. She kept saying things though and I’ll be honest, things have been rough for me for a while in regards to life (parents divorce, failing exams etc etc) and I’ve been trying to hold it together but I ended up bursting right then and there of everything I had bottled up.

No, I didn’t snap at her- I did however burst into tears (a bit embarrassing as she’s the kid and I was supposed to be the adult) and my aunt immediately started comforting me and everyone got angry at my cousin (she kept saying things like “yeah cry, I don’t care”). 

My aunt took her aside and told her off and said she wouldn’t be allowed to go somewhere she wanted to unless she changed her behaviour. I did settle down as quick as I could and just kinda ended up feeling sad for the rest of the time.

Later, she came to me and said sorry and apologised and hugged me, and of course I forgave her. She kept coming and apologising several times and I told her it was okay each time and that she had apologised once already so that was enough and she didn’t need to worry. Then later in the day I noticed she was missing and found her laying down with her head in her arms face down on the stairs and asked her what was wrong.

She started tearing up and said that she lied when she said she didn’t care that I was crying and that every time she thought about how I had cried, it made her want to cry too. She said that I had a very cute cry and that I was her favourite person and she had lied that I wasn’t.

I instantly reassured her that everything was okay and that she didn’t need to feel sad about it because I wasn’t sad about it anymore.

But yeah, I do love my cousins a lot. They have a lot of empathy for their age and are quite smart and sweet. I feel quite blessed to have them and love taking care of them. ",excited,wholesome

the security company must have been incredibly relieved and grateful to have it returned. It’s so heartwarming to see this level of honesty and integrity still alive today!

He ran to his kitchen and he tried to make some mac and cheese, but added too much milk. He was so excited to make something for me and felt bad about messing it up so I went on a huge rave about how it was the best thing I’ve ever had. That was also the first time I told him I loved him. The way he looked at me after that will never leave my mind. To this day, he will joyfully tell anyone how he made me fall in love with him with “mac and cheese soup”. The truth is, the “soup” is okay, but I fell in love with him because he is the most generous and amazing person I have ever known.

"An accidental voice memo changed my view of my parents.  I grew up in a home with parents with what I’d call high expectations. Get A’s in school, play varsity sports, just be the best type of stuff. Through out all of this me and my siblings never really were told that we did well/met expectations etc. I always thought that I was just scraping by as “good enough” as my parents really never said otherwise. 

Fast forward 15 years. I’m married. I have kids of my own. I still talk with my parents weekly. But I’ve lived the past 8 years believing that my parents were not proud of me because I dropped out of engineering school to work IT instead. 

A little more backstory, my parents are not tech savvy and they often “butt dial”. This past week a random voice message showed up in my text convo with my dad. It was 10 minutes long and it was a conversation between my parents. You could tell from audio quality that the phone was in my dad’s pocket. 

My parents were talking about me and my siblings and how proud they were they we were all happily married and in successful careers. They talked about the road bumps that we had seen along the way but we had all overcome them. I ended up crying for like 30 minutes because it just overcame me with emotions. These were words I had wanted to hear for over half my life. 

I have looked back at my childhood since hearing the message and realize that even though they had never explicitly said they were proud they never discouraged us. My parents are clearly reserved people and don’t know how to express these things to their kids so this is an amazing happy accident. 

TLDR: My parents left a heartwarming message that changed my view of them of the past 15 years for the better. ",excited,wholesome

"Moved Back In With Dad at 33 My wife (33F) and I (33M) have been together for 13 years and married for the past 2. We recently had our first child, a 7-month-old son, and honestly, he's amazing. We also have a 90lb Lab/Rottweiler mix who thinks he's a lap dog and is a big scaredy cat.

Recently, we stumbled across our dream home in a new community being built within the school zone we really wanted for our son. It was a perfect opportunity, so we put down a deposit, and the house is set to be finished by November 1st. Of course, that meant we needed to sell our current home. I did some fixes, got it listed in late June, and figured it would take a couple of months to sell.

I had started looking for short-term rentals in case we sold the house early, but wow, those are expensive! So, I called my dad and asked if we could stay with him temporarily when our house sold, and he was excited to have us back.

Then, our house sold in 12 hours. We got an offer $40K over asking, no inspections, with the only condition being we had to be out in two weeks. It was too good to pass up. My dad was super understanding, got a room ready for us, and even helped move our stuff into storage and his place.

Fast forward to last Saturday—my wife went out of town to visit her folks with our son and dog. I stayed back for work. That night, I found myself alone in my childhood room. The walls were still the same color, the shelves unchanged, even the deep gouge I made while moving furniture out for college was still there. Sitting on the floor with a cup of tea, I was flooded with memories—good, bad, exciting, and everything in between. I felt grateful for the childhood I had, and I started thinking about how I want my son to have that same feeling when he grows up.

As I sat there, my dad knocked on the door and asked if he could come in. He saw me sitting on the floor and seemed surprised, but he sat down on the bed and asked what was on my mind.

I thought for a second, then said, ""Dad, last time I lived here, all that immediately mattered to me was in this room—my TV, models, Legos, Xbox, computer. It was my stuff, and I couldn’t imagine leaving without it. Now, I'm back, and none of that matters. The only immediate things I care about in this room now are my wife, my son, and dog. Nothing else.""

He smiled, patted my knee, and said, ""Welcome to fatherhood, son. It's amazing how your perspective changes as you grow into the man and husband your family relies on. Never stop growing, learning, and loving. This is the life your mom and I wanted for you. Love you.""

Then he got up and left.

It was such a small moment, but it meant a lot to me. It really hit home how much things have changed, how much I’ve grown.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. Just wanted to share a wholesome moment from life :)",excited,wholesome

"I revealed the truth about my dad’s dad through Ancestry. This happened over the summer but this story is truly too amazing to not share. I went to visit my biological dad over the summer with my sister and boyfriend. I moved away about 6 hours from him with my mom and stepdad about 4 years ago. I went on this trip to visit and show my long term boyfriend my hometown because I currently live in the area he grew up in.
 
Anyways, last Christmas, I bought myself an Ancestry DNA package just for fun. I’m super into the whole “where you come from” thing. The other really huge mystery that I wanted to discover was who my real grandfather was. My grandmother had multiple children with a few different gentlemen, so my whole life there was speculation as to who my grandfather was. My grandmother did not even know for sure. I believe my dad was aware of all the speculation, but chose to shut it out because he wanted to believe that the man who raised him was his biological dad. He passed long before I was born, so I never knew any of my potential grandfather’s family. My dad has ancestry himself, but never purchased the DNA kit.

So I get my results back and it shows a list of people that you match with but I didn’t know but maybe a few relatives on the list and there were no members that stood out. 

Fast forward to this past summer and I’m sitting down at the kitchen table with my dad talking to him about my results. I was showing him all the features that you unlock when you send in your DNA,then I clicked on the “matches” tab. I started reading off the matches when he stopped me on one of them. The relative in particular went by the nickname, Aggie, online. He said, “Like Agatha?”
I confirmed that’s who it was.

He looked at me with tears in his eyes and told me that Aggie was his Aunt…his dad’s sister. I matched with her, confirming that the man that raised him was his biological dad. He burst into tears because now after almost 50 years, he knows the truth. 

All I could do was cry with him as I saw closure fall over him. After he and I confirmed the truth, we talked more about other relatives and I filled in more on my tree. It was really one of the most special moments I have ever had with my dad and I hope it brings some people a heartfelt smile.",excited,wholesome

"Falling in love with my husband again 

I’ve been with my husband for 13 years, married 10.  We have overall had a pretty good relationship, but both struggled with our own personal issues over the last 4 years or so which has led to some drifting apart.  Things were never bad, we were always still affectionate with each other but I’ll admit my temper with him became short, I didn’t really value our time together and we’d kind of just hang out in the same room together not really engaging with each other and just doing different things.  I won’t say I ever fell out of love with him-I never doubted it for a second.  I guess it was just that we had let things grow a little stale.  Things were ok in the bedroom but definitely didn’t have the level of passion we once did.  Every now and then we’d really connect deeply but it was not all the time.

Most recently I had issues with him not attempting to grow/change and kind of took personal offense to it.  Mostly just being healthy  to be around for our family.

I asked about counseling and I think he thought things were really bad and I was contemplating leaving or something, which was absolutely not the case- I just wanted things to be better.  He didn’t go for it but as I was looking online I stumbled across the Gottman Institute.  I ordered a few of the books and have been doing a self study.

While reading it I realized that I was a huge part of the problem.  I wasn’t being supportive, I was constantly nagging, not appreciating all he does for us.  I wasn’t prioritizing us and was  taking advantage of his kindness.  It really hit me- I cried so many tears over it, thinking about how despite whatever issues he was going through he never failed to show me love.  He was always there.  

This completely flipped my perspective- I started practicing turning toward him.  It’s really so easy.  Being more present, looking for opportunities to show him how much I care.  Last week he left his wallet in my car and I had to drive it to him in the middle of the work day (he was at a car service place so he couldn’t come to me).  A few weeks ago I would have been so annoyed with him for this and focus on how it screwed up MY day.  I was actually so eager to do something for him- so glad I got an opportunity to do something for him.  

He hasn’t read the books but I’ve been sharing what I’ve learned with him.  I’ve only really just scratched the surface of it all but the difference just a very small amount of change in my actions and attitude has been amazing.

I also didn’t expect this, but my feelings for him are suddenly ramping up.  I didn’t know butterflies were possible again.  It really feels like it did when we first met, only better because I know 100% he knows me and loves me and I feel so secure in that.  I think about him all the time, I can’t wait to see him at the end of the day and I can’t think of anything I’d rather do than spend quality time with him.  Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this wholesome post.

"My daughter made me cry today... Today after I (39F) picked my daughter (12F) up from school, we were sitting in the car, waiting. We were looking at apartments because our 2 bedroom apartment s getting kind of small for our family. There's 3 of us; my kids are in need of thier own spaces now that they're teenages/preteens. So, apartment looking we went.

It was just me and her this afternoon and as were sitting in the car she says how she likes being at our home, my kids are with their dad half the time.

She told me that, ""When I'm with you I feel at home."" 

When she said this I didn't think that much into it, i gave her a kiss on her head and said i feel the same with you. Now that I'm reflecting I can't stop crying. 

These past couple years have been so hard on me mentally, I lost my job earlier this year, I'm in a relationship that's been difficult and it's killing my self-worth and self-esteem. I can't talk to my family, I dont have friends I can really open up to. I think often of taking my life. I think all the time that the people I love will be happier without me. I feel constantly that I'm not good enough for the people around me. 

But to have her say that to me is beyond any words I can ever put together. I didn't have a good relationship with my mom growing up, I was scared of her and she was so unkind and mentally unstable and just mean hearted. She made me want to run away from home, so to have my daughter say that to me is just so special. I look at my daughter all the time and am just so amazed with what a wonderful person she is. Seeing her do and experience all the things I wish I did when I was little, is so healing.

I hope everyone finds someone they can call home.

"I (24 trans man) found a family and a safe home for the first time this year Trigger warning: mentions of past abuse, SA

I (24 trans man) grew up in an abusive household. My biological father was emotionally unavailable and checked out, and he and my biological sister have always been enablers of my biological mother, who was the abuser in my family. My mom was told when I was 3 that I was autistic, and that she should get me accommodations as I grew up and went to school. My mom told the doctor that she would not be getting me help, because if I struggled enough, I would ""figure it out and catch up"". The problem is that not getting me help meant that I never learned how to handle autistic meltdowns, and my mom's abuse came out when those happened. At 6, my mom would threaten to bash my head into the wall and fracture my skull if I didn't stop crying. She also used a lie that we were below the poverty line (I learned as an adult we weren't) to justify being unable to afford only food for me, so that I would not eat so I would be skinny - I'm built bigger and she hated that. She starved me a lot growing up, and would frequently tell me how much I ruined her life, and how she was happy before I came around.

Fast forward to October 2023. 23 years old. I was distant from my family and had spent most of the year getting very close with a 36 year old man that hosted an open mic night I started attending after being SA'd at the beginning of the year. This guy, Andrew - a music therapist, saw me as a very lost person, and he took me under his wing and began mentoring me as a budding musician in the local scene. Mentoring became big brothering, and big brothering turned into parenting. My bio parents stopped parenting me when I was 15 because I was ""a grown up"" and didn't need parenting anymore. Over the last year, Andrew and I have become inseparable. He became my family, took financial responsibility for me, and became my biggest cheerleader in my mental health, my career, my education, and my transition. I started hormones in January of this year, and will be having chest surgery in December.

In August, my mom threw me out after deciding I was not allowed to live at home if I was going to ""continue being trans"". Andrew lives in a one bedroom, but he moved me in that night and has given me a home. A month later, after going no contact with my bio family, Andrew signed adoption papers - adult adoptions are a real thing in my state and are a simple process. I started grad school, getting a master's in music therapy, and he's been supporting me every step of the way. He's now lovingly dubbed DadBro.

Living with Andrew and being adopted by him is the best thing that's ever happened to me. There's no screaming, no shaming, no being punished for eating, no abuse, no gaslighting, no passive aggressive comments, nothing. We're binging some shows together, and on Sunday mornings before I go to a local queer church, we make eggs and coffee and have breakfast together as a special weekend thing since he works on Saturdays and I usually leave for class before he's awake during the week. We have an extensive record collection and frequently hang out and listen through albums, and he's been trying to reparent me and help me unlearn unhelpful thought patterns and learn better ways to be. This usually includes us laying on the couch in pajamas and watching Bluey or movies for my inner child while he scratches my head and lets me lean into him for comfort. He's very generous with his affection, and I don't need to earn it or cure cancer for him to tell me he's proud of me, something that was very difficult with my bio family. In November, I'll be spending my first thanksgiving with his (our, now) family. I have a safe, warm home and a dad who makes me feel worthy and loved. What a lovely little life I have these days.

TLDR: I came from an abusive family and was thrown out last year for being trans. I moved in with a father figure/big brother friend, and he adopted me, and my life has been the most amazing gift ever since.",excited,wholesome

"Met my childhood hero and cried  I met Peter today at NFCC and cried

Today my sister and wife took me to Niagara Falls Comic Con in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

I am disabled and traveling is remarkably hard and usually expensive. This is the first convention I have been to since I had my left leg amputated in 2017.

I was offered the chance to go to NFCC and was amazingly surprised that Peter was a guest. So we bought photo ops and tickets and rented a van and flash forward to today.

I got my photo op first today and Peter was amazingly gracious and kind. He even gave me a nice squeeze on my shoulder and got down on my level in my wheelchair. What really was the transformative experience was what happened in the autograph line.

The room was packed and Peter was between, Robert Patrick and Edward James Olmos. The line was very crowded and some people were less than kind BUT NFCC did an astounding job. The con staff put me in a good place in my wheelchair so that i could easily get in line and meet Peter.

After 45 minutes, i was able to finally able to get up and meet Peter. His handler asked me what i’d like Peter to write on my Arrow video 4K special edition insert poster and i said “Something inspirational”.

Peter recognized me from me from before and I said Hello and he asked me why I wanted something inspirational.
 
“Dr Weller, you are the hero that I needed to have as a child. You taught me the value of Protect the innocent and to be a good person and to do the right thing, always.”

I have met celebrities before as i work in media but today was different. Today, i was before my hero and i was a 5 year old kid.

He smiled at me and said, let me share with you my favorite quotes from the movie as he signed my poster. I thanked him profusely and shook his hand. If i could have stood up, i probably would have asked for a hug even if it was cringy.

I know its childish and stupid but today, i needed a win from a rough few weeks and  arguably the last few years. 

Peter made me feel like a child again and for a magical few minutes, i actually cried tears of joy.

I know i’ll probably never get a chance to meet him again but today was beautiful and i just wanted to share it.",excited,wholesome

We crawled around the living room as ""little alligator"" and ""daddy alligator"", as she spotted ""fish"" to eat.

Me and my friend were out hanging out, like we usually do, and we stopped by this plaza with a bunch of stores and we were hungry so we decided to get some Dunkin’ Donuts. I remember buying my doughnut with him and we sat down and ate it. And while we were doing that, I noticed a lady who didn’t look too well enter the store. I didn’t think anything of that, until I saw her ask for a donut and she proceeded to pull out pennies and it was taking her a really long time to get them all out. I immediately felt sorry for her as it was obvious she was probably struggling financially. I looked at my friend and asked him if I should buy her a donut and a drink and he told me I should. I walked up to the lady in a kind manner and asked if I can buy her a donut as well as a drink. She immediately got lit up with a smile but didn’t want to accept my money. I told her that I insist and I must. I bought her what she wanted and she told me when I go back home to tell my mother about it. I did just that the second I got home. I hope she’s doing better now.

"chef at sports camp was extremely accommodating of my ED :) i was telling my fiancé about this and he said ""the people of Reddit need to hear that, that's adorable"" so here we are. 
so i (18, NB) have had eating problems since i was a child, one of which being extremely picky eating. one of my sports has an annual weekend camp, which i always go to. we've had a professional chef who's a friend of my instructors providing the meals for the last 3 years who we will call J. 
last year he noticed that i was only eating salad because there was no other food i could eat so he asked me ""do you like airfried chips?"" and i said yeah then he went out of his way to peel potatoes, cut them up, season them, and cook them in the air fryer. he made airfryer chips just for me because i couldn't eat anything else. then, when it was quiet he pulled me aside and asked me ""what do you like to eat, ill prepare stuff for tomorrow and make note for next year"" (this year) and i told him about my safe foods. then this year, one of the meals was a pasta thing but it had lots of stuff i couldn't eat in it and the only plain pasta i could see was the gluten free stuff for certain people so i was panicking a bit, J saw me looking around and said ""dont worry, i set some plain pasta aside. i can make a tomato sauce if you'd like?"" i told him that i was okay with cheese for then, but that a tomato sauce for the following day would be great, and then he made me some tomato pasta separate the next day. i truly appreciate someone being so accommodating as i know that my eating problems are annoying, cause my problems relate to calories and also limited food vocabulary so i can be tough to feed, but he didn't bat an eye, just asked me what i like, and did that. it means so so much to me and i already said thank you a bunch, but i want him to know just how much that actually meant to me. people can be so dismissive of eating disorders especially when it's an EDNOS type disorder, so it means a lot for someone to be so understanding :)

I have no idea where he found this thing.. it had pictures of about 50 bbreeds of cows and a checklist in the back where you could keep track of the ones you saw.. he spotted a Scottish highland cow for the first time and was over the moon...

This was before my stepmother told him she was the daughter of a dairy farmer. I'm convinced that played a role in their eventual marriage. To this day there is a small wall in their house dedicated to the first time he met the family cows.

"Today I(18) dropped the bombshell on my younger cousin (8) that I'm autistic just like him. His eyes got really big and he asked me if that's why we both like Pokemon; so I said ""yeah, maybe!"" He started to tell me about how his grandpa (my uncle) said he was special because of his condition. I'm quoting him directly here, he said: ""If im special and you're special...then were both special so we can always be friends!"" Anyways I literally almost cried my eyes out right there. I don't really know how to describe what I felt but I think it's due to growing up as a late diagnosed autist and not knowing what was wrong with me. I would have killed to have an older person with the same condition as me to give me support and reassurance growing up-- and I'm so glad that I have the opportunity to do that for him. I want him to feel good about himself as he grows up and for him to see that he's not alone. I adore that lil guy and I can't wait until he and I can talk in more depth once he's older. Until then though, I think playing several rounds of the Pokemon card game with him every so often will suffice.

Side note: I asked about his favorite Pokemon. He said his favorite was Rowlette (I told him that I like Lotad and Lucario) and we did actually play a few rounds of the physical trading card game just yesterday. Well later another cousin came up to join and she's interested in pokemon too so she asked what his favorites were as well....can you guess what he said?? HE SAID LUCARIO LOL. (what can I say, man? lil bro's got good taste.)

Edit: I'm actually auDHD but I didn't want to get stuck on such technicalities since he only has autism and that's the focus of this story. Thank you all so much for your support and kind words. ♥️",excited,wholesome
"My daughter’s boyfriend is such an amazing young man TLDR at the end because this got wordier & gushier than necessary. 

Backstory: my husband & I have 3 kids, with a huge age-gap between the first & second (thaaanks, thyroid cancer). But we are vehemently against “using” our oldest (17yo F) in any kind of a parental role [parentification = BAD]. 

She has certainly helped out before in a pinch or when there was a want / need for assistance, and we’ve always compensated her for her efforts. She is not our only fallback for planned or rare last-minute childcare needs, and she’s never guilted or coerced. But we do try to give her first “dibs” - if she wants to make a little extra money. (End backstory)
_______________________________

Lately, our oldest kiddo (who I’ll call ‘Gwen’) and her boyfriend (‘Peter’) have been WANTING to do more things for/with her little siblings. It’s so heartwarming! It’s obvious that they both genuinely adore her 6yo little sister (‘Aviva’) and 3yo little brother (‘Buzz’). 

A week & a half ago, Gwen & Peter took Aviva to the movie theatre to watch “Inside Out” and then out to eat & ice cream. It was so sweet, and Aviva hasn’t stopped talking about it since. 

Peter felt bad that they were able to do something fun & special with Aviva but not Buzz. So tonight, after he got off work to come see Gwen, Peter dropped off the sweetest little surprise for buzz:  a big, soft Chase puppy stuffy! My kids barely know the show, but Buzz loves all animals (especially dogs & cats) — and Peter’s gift was an instant hit!

I (and Buzz) enthusiastically thanked Peter before he & Gwen left to spend some time together. I later texted Gwen how amazing that was of Peter, but he did not have to do that! Buzz may not have even known about Aviva’s adventure, and he surely wouldn’t have remembered it. Gwen said that Peter just really wanted to do something for Buzz to show him he was loved & special too. What an extraordinary young man, truly. 

Bedtime tonight was a breeze with Buzz as he happily snuggled his new stuffie to sleep. A rare treat in & of itself! I just realized that Peter’s gift to Buzz was a gift to me as well. Gosh, I hope both my Littles grow up to be as amazing as Gwen & Peter.

"Cows have best friends, just like we do! 🥹 “The claim that cows have best friends is rooted in scientific research. Studies have shown that cows are social creatures, forming strong bonds with specific individuals in their herd. 

A study by Krista McLennan at the University of Northampton in the UK found that when cows were isolated from their preferred companion, they exhibited signs of stress, such as elevated heart rates and cortisol levels. When reunited with their preferred companion, these stress indicators decreased significantly, suggesting that cows experience emotional attachments to specific individuals.” -Walt Whitney for “Fact/Myth.com”

"My boyfriend is just ridiculously loving. He's one of the good ones.  I've had horribly abusive partners in the past to the extent of controlling what I could wear and whom I could talk to. 

My current boyfriend is not only the first healthy relationship I've ever had, but is also the first and most amazing boyfriend I could have ever dreamed of. 

I've been trying really hard to go to him immediately when I have an issue and I have been good about it and 100% of the time, he's validated my feeling and worked with me to work through them together as a team.

I'm not really sure what else to say. He's gorgeous, fit, sexy... But more importantly he's kind, smart, and funny. 

I'm not sure what I did right in my life to earn his love but having it.. I'm beyond happy. He's the most amazing, the funniest, the most gorgeous man I've ever met.

We are doing our first out of state trip next month for his birthday that I've planned out but before that, he'll be the first man I've dated to ever ask me to meet his parents (whom are really excited to meet me by all accounts). 

Again. I don't know what good karma I put into the world to be here with this man, but I did something right. I'm going to marry this one. 

UPDATE: This is what happens when I drink vodka I guess. Thank you all for such lovely sentiments regarding this. Good ones are out there and we do care about each other very much. For those expressing that they are in the same boat or have happy marriages, I'm so happy for you! For those saying they had their hopes renewed, I'm so glad! Good people are out there and you deserve one. For the one person telling me my boyfriend is going to become violent, you ok? 

Anyway, thanks for reading my drunken posting. He's a keeper. We have worked through all issues together as a team and are really happy together.

"Had the cutest interaction with my younger cousin Was at my younger cousin's 21st birthday in the dining room recharging my spoons while almost everyone else was out in the pool. My younger cousin came into the room. Now I want to say, he and I are both on the Autism spectrum and he is nonverbal, but I always make sure I talk to him and make him feel included. He came over and leaned his head on my shoulder, his way of giving hugs. It's the first time he's ever done so, and I was so touched by the moment, I started tearing up. Then when it was time for cake, he didn't go over to his mom, he came to me and pointed at his mouth, indicating he wanted a bite or two. I asked his mom if it was okay and she said yes, so I shared a few bites of my cake with him. It was two sweet moments that I really wanted to share here because I thought they were super cute!",excited,wholesome

"I got a primary school bully to stop bullying me by teaching him how to knit Sounds absolutely ridiculous, right? I know. This guy absolutely made primary school a living hell for me for years until one day, I was knitting at lunchtime and he came over, sat himself next to me and was asking all sorts of questions, taking an interest in what I was doing. He wasn’t actively bullying me in this moment, so although I was hesitant at first, I indulged him and answered all his questions. He sat and watched me work for a while after that in silence, then stood up and announced that he would come back and show me what he learned. Of course, I didn’t think anything would come of it, but I didn’t hear from the guy for a long while. Weeks. I even started to worry about him, as silly as it sounds. Him bullying me every day had become a daily ritual for him until he saw me knitting that day. Sure enough though, he was true to his word and came back with a huge, chunky blanket that he told me was for his Mum. He thanked me for teaching him despite everything and even apologised to me for previously having bullied me. I was shocked, and of course forgave him, congratulating him. We were actually friendly from then on. Not super close, but smiling and waving as we passed each other and such. Eventually as we moved to different high schools, we naturally drifted apart. 

A few years later while I was in high school, I was at a sleepover at my best friend’s house of at least 6 years, looking out a window and shooting the shit with her. All of a sudden, I stop what I was saying mid-sentence. My jaw drops. “OH MY GOD ITS HIM!!” 

Her: *confused* “Who?” 

Me: “The dude who stopped bullying me in primary school when I taught him how to knit!!” 

Her: “What?? No way! That’s my neighbour!”

We decided to pay him a visit, and he was just as shocked to see me as I was to see him. He got very excited, inviting us both in to see his old blanket that he made and a few other projects he’d done. His parents were out for the weekend, so we stayed for most of the afternoon, chatting away and making up for lost time. Still makes me smile. ",excited,wholesome

"Little girl that lifted my spirits  Today, I was really missing my family. My two kids have been in Europe with their mom for the past five weeks because their grandma needed surgery. It’s been tough not having them around, and with one more week to go before they return, the loneliness was hitting hard. So instead of staying in, I decided to go for a walk, hoping it would clear my mind.

As I was heading out through the garage, I saw a neighbor with her little granddaughter. This sweet girl, just a year and a half old, caught me off guard with a cheerful ""hi."" I turned around, smiled, and greeted her back, along with her grandma. This tiny girl ran up to me, wrapped herself around my leg, and held my hand like we were the best of friends. 

Her grandma tried to get her to come back, but the little one wasn’t having it. She insisted on walking with me, her tiny hand in mine, while her grandma followed, trying to coax her away. We all ended up laughing together as we walked, and her grandma mentioned how this was completely unlike her. She wouldn’t even go to people she’s known forever, yet here she was, choosing to walk with me.

That small, unexpected moment completely lifted my spirits. The sadness I’d been carrying vanished, replaced by this simple joy.

I walked away feeling lighter, happier, and so grateful for this brief, beautiful reminder of the love that surrounds us all, even when our loved ones are far away.",excited,wholesome

"I had a bad day. So I’ve been having a rough couple of weeks lately, been stressed and didn’t have the energy to even leave my bed.

Yesterday I was in a bit of a crisis and on the edge of having a panic attack, I knew I needed to distract myself so I decided to have a little walk in the park, listen to some music and try to calm myself down.

I ended up not only calming myself down but really appreciating being able to enjoy the wind, the sun, the music, the dogs running around me and the moment. 

I know sometimes things may feels hopeless and not worth fighting for, but sometimes all we need is a little moment to realize that maybe everything is not as bad as it seems, maybe tomorrow can get better.

Sometimes all we need is a different perspective than the thoughts we keep trapped inside. 

It’s okay to feel bad, it’s to have a bad day or week or month or year, let yourself feel the things you have to feel, don’t avoid them, face them and move forward because that is not everything there is to it. 

Do that thing you want to do, ask that person out, because the truth is the only thing stopping you is you. 

You ARE worth it and you deserve good things, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 

We just need to try a little harder, you and I will be okay. 

Be kind. ",excited,wholesome

"I'm kicking depression's ass Hi guys -

I don't know if this belongs here....but I just feel so overwhelmed with my emotions that I want to share them with someone! I have battled on and off depression for *years.* I can remember as early as 10 years old speaking with adults about my ""mood swings"" and being told I was depressed. I've gone through waves...having up years, down years. Sometimes both.

But something I have never managed to do is feel as if I am *living* my life. I have always felt like I was just existing here. Counting down the days to the inevitable...some days hoping that inevitable day would come sooner.

But, I decided to swap out my focus from my mental state to my physical state. I just decided that I needed something to work towards, and I felt like I was treading water with my mental health. So, I switched to something that I *knew* would feel more fruitful. What I didn't know is how much fixing my physical health and habits would affect my mental health!

Here are a few things about me, now:

1. I have plants! They are thriving because I am! I have killed so many innocent plants and I have finally found the love and desire for them and my life to actually foster a consistent connection.
2. I am creative again! I have so many ideas swirling around in my head and I have actually been devoting the time and energy to writing them down and even implimenting a few already. I've recently been painting, writing song lyrics, and trying to pickup the guitar.
3. I'm finally traveling! I have booked a cruise with my best friend of over 10 years (next fall), and it will be my first ever international trip. I have only ever traveled less than 5 times my whole life, all within driving distance to me. I have always been too afraid and unwilling to pursue the steps. I buckled down and made the plans, and now its happening. :')
4. I value social interaction again! I used to *loath* interacting with ""humans"" as I'd refer to people as. I couldn't stand the pleasantries or the energy it took to participate in a conversation. I now find myself *driving* conversations and really feeling connected to those around me.
5. My partner and I are doing regular activities together again! I used to just rot for hours...dreading having to interract with even the person I loved most because of the shame/guilt cycle that would come after. But, we've recently taken up a super fun co-op game, one of our favorite shows just released a new season, he's been aiding my guitar interests (he's a musician), and we've been discussing content creation with a more serious focus. Our communication is peaking, being parents together brings me so much joy.

I know that I am currently in a season of life, and life will find a way to grant me more experiences that will be difficult. I know that I will have lows again. But, I am so excited about living right now...losing this high on life is not even in my peripherals. Thanks for reading if you made it here. <3 You can do it, too.",excited,wholesome

"Landscaper Surprises Overeager Kids...Everyone Liked That! I work from home in a grass apartment complex and every day at 3pm. the landscapers come.

Today started heavy leaf blowing with the advent of Autumn and they make three gigantic piles of leaves in each of the major complexes

At around 3:30 I see a bunch of kids coming up from the driveway and one of them sort of stops a short distance from the landscaper with the leafblower. She's gotta be like 8 and she's soon joined by 3-4 other kids and theyre all standing in a circle but I see them keep pointing to the pile and looking over at the oblivious landscaper.

He finally moves on to the next apartment and I start laughing as I see the kids waste ZERO time in running into and jumping into the leaf piles.

I see the landscaper turn around and look at them and he walks over and I think ""oh man, theyre gonna get in trouble?""

Sure enough they all stop and kind of look at him as he comes over, 3 of the kids even take a few big steps back as though they weren't just doing it and the landscaper says nothing and just blows all the leaves back into a big pile for them. He does this like 5 to 6 more times, even laughing a little as the kids do some of their wildest jumps and rolls.

"My boyfriends the best I 19 F, have been with my boyfriend 21 M for almost 6 months, but we've been friends for over a year. 

He's truly been the best boyfriend I've ever had. He's everything i could ever look for in a guy. I thought I'd never be able to be loved by someone because I am neurodivergent (of the autism kind) I have quite a lot of relationship trauma, that I have been in therapy for, but he's helped me heal in so many ways. 

I used to think my autism was a burden, but I don't now because of how he treats it. He'll always make sure that whatever we do isn't going to overstimulate me or overwhelm me, if I do he's there to comfort me and help me calm down (he's a safe person so him being there is more helpful than not), we cuddle a lot, and when we hear a loud car zooming by, it spooks me sometimes, but he covers my ears so it doesn't. If I'm being weird instead of just being weirded out he'll match the energy, I stim a lot and sometimes if I am stimming audibly he'll join in. He tells me all the time that he loves everything about me, and is always reassuring me he's never going anywhere and that he only wants me. I'm his first girlfriend because no other girl has given him a chance. (He has health problems of his own that's scared people off, I'm not afraid of them, and have been there for him in his time of need)

 I want to shower this man in all my love and marry him someday and bear him children. I've never had this feeling with any other man. He gives me this feeling I can't describe, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. ",excited,wholesome

"I just discovered my father is a wonderful person My father never talks much about his past and is a quiet person in general, so I never knew much about him. My mother met him 10 years ago, after she divorced from her previous husband, but she is not the easiest person to talk about past with, since every discussion diverts about her life instead. The only sure thing I learnt is that my father worked in finance and given his acrimonious sense of humour I just assumed he was one of those people who sold their soul to the devil in order to make money and therefore such was the reason why he kept his life a secret.

Today I happened to find his phone unguarded on the kitchen table, when a message was just being sent to him: it was a woman thanking him for the money he sent her for attending university, with a picture of her with a Medicine degree in hand and the biggest smile I've ever seen, with the text ""6 years ago doing drugs, now prescribing them 🥰"" . Curiosity took over me and I looked through his chats, discovering another man whose studies were in part payed by my father; there were also 2 other people thanking him for the support and parenting advice he gave them raising their difficult kids (I don't want to seem offensive, that's the kind way we use in my country to call disabled kids). It wasn't all. Inside his desk I found some printed emails of an Eritrean kid with some of the most heartwarming words I ever read.

I was honestly baffled, because I never thought of my father as someone generous, let alone a kind individual. He has always been the rough and grim type of dad, those you admire for their strength and hard work, but not for their empathetic side. He is the father who makes you study harder (which I am thankful of), though not the one who compliments for the grades you get. Actually, thinking about it I get one of the possible reasons why we always lived in small houses and in a spartan way, given his salary. Maybe he wanted to teach us humbleness, maybe he spent the money helping these people; either way that's unexpected and wonderful.

I am sorry for the kilometric post, I just wanted to share a wholesome moment with y'all! Never assume to know everything of a person, I guess.",excited,wholesome

"A Photographer Captures Moment Two Widowed Penguins Enjoy Melbourne Skyline Together. The photo was taken by Tobias Baumgaertner in Melbourne.

He was told that the two penguins had recently lost their partners and often appeared to be comforting each other.

St Kilda Pier in Melbourne has a colony of around 1,400 fairy penguins, the smallest penguin species with an average height of just 33cm (13 inches). The colony is monitored by volunteers.

""A volunteer approached me and told me that the white one was an elderly lady who had lost her partner and apparently so did the younger male to the left,"" Mr Baumgaertner wrote. 

""Since then they meet regularly, comforting each other and standing together for hours watching the dancing lights of the nearby city.""
The photographer spent three nights with the penguin colony before being able to catch this photo, he said.

""Between not being able or allowed to use any lights and the tiny penguins continuously moving, rubbing their flippers on each other's backs and cleaning one another, it was really hard to get a shot,"" he said.

I sat there in silence eating my food slowly trying to not look at anyone and started to tear up. I was feeling upset, and I was on my period too so it just made it worse... Not sure if my dad knew, but he soon came behind me and gave me a small hug and told me to ""eat up"" with a tender smile on his face and gave me a kiss on my forehead.

"I am so happy today! I could help my best friend who was my rock when my mom was diagnosed with cancer.  My (28f) best friend (30f) was stuck in a toxic relationship for the past 11 years. I've known her for 14 years. My mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in 2019, then with Lymphoma in 2023 and for the third time, she's battling cancer again (relapse of Lymphoma).

I had a flight with my dad, woke up 4am to go to the train station, then the airport, and by the time we reached the airport, we were EXHAUSTED, but we knew the flight would be worth it.

Turns out to travel to Dubai (where we were going), your passport has to expire in a minimum of 6 months, mine was expiring in 5 months. Annoyed, upset and angry, we head home. My dad stops to go bathroom, and I'm waiting in front of a vending machine, deciding whether to buy a coke no sugar or not, I chose to. The person who restocks them had just happened to stop by to restock the machine, asked me what drink I wanted and told him what I wanted.

He hands me the drink, and I ask how do I pay? (The door was unlocked and open, so I didn't know), and (since I used Apple Wallet and have my card ready to pay), he puts his against the back of my phone like I'm actually paying with a machine. I'm confused because it was a $4 drink and I didn't know whether to pay, and he said since he was restocking them, it was fine, as long as I didn't tell anyone.

So, if that person happens to see this, thank you. I may not have shown it, but it seriously made my day, and I was REALLY happy.

Edit: I'd also like to mention it was my first time flying, and the 6-month passport rule was something I didn't know existed, and my dad didn't think it'd be expiring within the next 5 months (we were somewhat in a rush, we knew we had our own passports, but we didn't bother looking over any other info).

Another Edit: On the 2nd September (AEST) we flew out to China, then Dubai. I'm currently on my 3rd day stay!!",excited,wholesome

"My man bought me food for my break at work ❤️ I know this title seems like it’s the normal thing for relationships, but let me explain fully because I just need to tell someone I’m literally bursting 😭❤️

My bf (19M) and I both work at a bowling alley, and earlier today it was nearing the time where I should have a break. He was positioned on the bar and I was sorting out reception, and reorganising the ticket prizes there. I love to get jobs done before having breaks, so I was determined to finish it and working through it nicely.

He was the only one at the bar at that time, and he left his position just to ask me if I wanted him to buy me some food 🥹
I told him that it was okay, and that I was just going to finish this task and that I didn’t really need a break.
He asks me, are you sure? 
And I say yes, of course

Later on, I hear through my radio “‘OP’, could you come over to the bar for a second?” So I make my way over, and he tells me “your food is ready”
And he bought me my favourite items off our menu without me even asking him to and omfg I was so happyyy
So I had a really quick break and started reorganising again, and later on I get a message from him while he’s on his break:

“Sorry I forced you to go on a break, I didn’t want you to go without one again”

And my god, this man really cares sm Istg 😭😭😭
He buys me food and apologises for it because I told him i didn’t need a break! 
Such a sweet guy but damn is he okay 😭

Anyway yeah 🤣",excited,wholesome

"I'm sick. My high-energy, 69lb dog is sleeping on my lap. My dog (Tater Todd) is a 69lb, 2 year old Catahoula Leopard Dog. He's a Busy Business Boy - always up for an adventure - so of course I feel like crap today. I can't feasibly walk him in the rain while suffering a cold, so I tossed him lick toy in the hopes it might engage him until my spouse comes home. 

Todd slurped the toy for a minute, watching as I moped and snuffled around the house making tea and collecting various items. I'd barely levered myself onto the couch when he jumped up and started stomping all over me and licking my hands/face (NO THANK YOU SIR, that is MY cheese I'm eating with my bare hands tyvm) and I just kind of patted him with the non-cheese-dominant hand and prayed for unconsciousness. 

In the middle of his stomp-love, he looked me dead in the eye and cocked his head. Looked concerned and nosed me gently. Then my good boy Todd crawled into my lap (I am 118lbs of petite butch; he weighs over 1/2 of me) and summarily passed out. Snoring now. I'm typing this over his head at the moment, and though our blanket is full of farts, at least they're both of our farts. 

I feel better already :)",excited,wholesome
"I (35F) went trick or treating last night Just as the title says I went trick or treating last night for the first time in 20 years and I had a blast. 

My niece turned 15 this year. She’s an awesome kid and she’s been through quite a bit, but she’s always been surrounded by loving and supportive adults, and she’s incredibly insightful. This year, after spending her birthday with her friends she decided she wanted to spend Halloween with her family, which meant me, her older brother, her mom and mom’s SO. We all love Halloween, horror and creepy things year round. 

She’s stuck in that stage of being a kid and getting free candy and also doing the more “grown up” side of Halloween, like haunts and gory films. Luckily, unlike some of her friends, she has no interest in experimenting with drugs and alcohol at her age. So this year we decided we’d give it one last go for the candy and then end the night with a really great haunted house. 

She was a little shy about going up to houses at her age, but you could tell she still really wanted to for the candy and to see the yard decorations.

So I decided to create a last minute sheet ghost costume that covered me from head to toe (I am short) and I got to walk alongside her and say “Trick or Treat!!” and get a little candy of my own. I even sacrificed a snickers for the mom tax to my sister. 

We only went to around 5 houses before she decided she was done with the candy part and wanted to move on to the haunt, where she and her brother ran ahead and got to scare their mom at least 3 good times. I was delighted because my sister, despite loving the season, has always refused to go through the haunts with us because she’s so jumpy. 

We had an absolute blast! If she decides she wants to go house to house next year, I’ll be planning out the best routes for us and creating another full body costume to accompany her. If she doesn’t, I’m so glad I got to goof off and make this memory with her this year. ",excited,wholesome
"My (21F) bf (21m) cooked me breakfast. I know this may be a casual thing for couples now especially those who live together, but my boyfriend cooked me breakfast due to him being thoughtful.

One morning, I'm at work and came across a facebook post featuring different types of asian breakfast which I loved the most. I sent it to him and told him that I miss having a good breakfast but I wasn't able to do so as I wake up very early to go to work and I don't have the time to cook.

The following day, I woke up to his 5AM messages and calls telling me that he cooked me something and that he will bring it to me before I go to work. I hugged him so tightly when I saw him and tbh, I dont wanna let go of him. He is so thoughtful and woke up at 4AM just to prepare something for me that I could eat. What he cooked is exactly the first photo of the FB post that I've sent to him.

He is such an angel. How could I not share this to everyone? I love him so much.",excited,wholesome

"In memory of a boss who believed in me This is going back close to 12 years now, but the impact of what happened has stuck with me.

Back then, I used to work for a call center as an agent. Now I am a quiet, and introverted person. Most times, people don’t notice me because I keep to myself and keep my head down while I work. BUT, I am also the sort of person that pays attention to the things around me and if I say something, it is generally short but very relevant/impactful.

The General Manager (and later CO) at the place I worked, I’ll call him MS, was a man who could be friendly one moment and raging up a storm the next. He never once insulted staff but he still intimidated others when he got angry. He also had an absolute love for Australian cricket, and every Friday without fail, he would send a company-wide (30 staff members in all) email with the weekly results. I think only he cared but nobody dared speak ill of his cricket.

One day, we had a virus attack our systems and after IT purged it, MS sent a company-wide email about the importance of not opening unknown links or attachments and to report any suspicious emails.

I don’t know what possessed me to do it, but I hit “Reply All” and sent back something along the lines of ""Now that you mention it, I have been getting these strange emails every week detailing Australian cricket scores.""

It is no word of a lie when I say the whole building went quiet. I mean, after I sent that email I genuinely thought I F’D up. But then you could hear MS’ belly laugh roar through the entire building (I resumed breathing at that point). What I hadn’t realized at that time though, is that by sending that email, I fell on his radar.

After that, he would approach me – especially during work events – and we would talk. Whenever there was a team leader position open, he would ask me why I didn’t apply, and I would tell him, that I didn’t feel confident in my abilities. At no point did he ever push me into taking a role I didn’t want. But he would listen and make a comment about how he thought I would be good for the role, but never pushed.

In time, his confidence in me did help, and while he was still working for the company, I became a trainer and even later took on an HR role. Eventually, MS would have to leave the company due to health reasons, but every now and then our paths would cross. The last I spoke with him was back in 2020, and I was happy to tell him I became a team leader. MS had been happy to hear that and he told me that he knew I had it in me.

MS passed away from his illness a few weeks later, but his belief in me stayed with me. When I had to leave the company we both worked at, I knew my worth. When I joined a company that was abusive to its staff, I did not put up with it. When I found another company that I enjoyed working at, I was confident to see myself learn and grow.

Today, I have accepted a managerial position in my company and wish I could share the news with MS. I know he would have been proud and told me that he knew I had it in me.",excited,wholesome

Today, I had a club after school that provides dinner, and I got to take some leftovers home (some chips and half a sleeve of Oreos).

On the bus, I overheard an older homeless man talking with the bus driver. The dude had been stranded somehow in Colorado for 17 years. It was his first time in my city, and he was obviously not having a good time, even with the already low standards. I had 3D printed a spinning ring fidget, and I noticed him looking at it. When he noticed that I noticed him looking at it, he asked if he could see it. I offered it to him and he asked if I knew a way he could make one for himself, and I told him he could keep that one. I also offered him the chips and Oreos, but he refused until I insisted that I really didn't need them. He also asked where the best place would be to get off to find a place to sleep, so I gave him my best guesses. He kept playing with the spinning rings for several minutes, and I saw that little kid feeling of wonder and happiness as he messed with it. At my stop, he noticed me put my backpack on to get off. He hurriedly introduced himself and thanked me again. 😭😭😭",excited,wholesome

"I don't give a shit if you're partners a fuckin two headed martian, they're welcome here (tl;dr at the end) thought about sharing this in the motorcycle club sub, but not sure how welcome it would be.  The mc world isn't normally this inclusive.

\*Disclaimer for those with knowledge of the mc world (if you're not doesn't really matter too much): BACA is an association not a club.  When I refer to territory, I'm referring to recruiting territory, not held territory.  Though most chapters are part of their local Coalition Of Clubs.

I'd call myself a gay, redneck, combat vet, biker.  Fit in well with the harley crowd, definitely blend in at biker bars etc.

I joined Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA) may 2023 officially.  My original chapter, in the northern midwest, was not necessarily homophobic, but not the most openly inclusive place either.  Don't need to go into details there, but my pres and my sponsor knew I was gay, and were fine with it.

Got tired of puttin up the bike for 4 months out of the year, so in may this year put plans in place to move to Texas September 1.  Then in June kinda started falling for a trans gal.  Wasn't really that big of a deal up north, as I was already kinda one foot out the door.  Just told no pride flags on me or my bike, but on her was fine (TBC that was the COC rules, not the chapter's rules).

Anyway, in may I attended the meeting to the k chapter I was expecting to join, making sure it was a good fit, and the first thing I see is a gal with a rainbow peace sign on her cut.  So immediately I'm like, alright, cool.  After the meeting ask her if they're pretty open minded, and she confirms that they are.

So pull their pres aside, and tell him I'm gay.  Wasn't datin the trans gal at the time, so didn't ask about that.  Kinda made it clear that it wasn't the first thing people knew about me, but if people got to know me it'd come out.  And he's super chill etc.

So I move down here sep 1, renting a room in another (n) chapter's territory with approval, with the intention of moving to the k chapter's territory as soon as possible (and getting my gal down here too-damn I miss her but two more weeks).  Let a couple people know directly, mainly the training coordinator, and someone who likely will be my sponsor next month, and they don't give a shit.

Well couple times I ride up to K chapter events with a few N chapter members.  But apparently, they're not quite so open minded-which I didn't realize this until later.  But a couple weeks ago, with one of the members of N chapter I let the word partner slip, didn't even think about it, came up in conversation.

Well later that day, my pres pulls me aside and told me someone said I was ""pushing my lifestyle"".  I immediately got defensive, thinkin I wasn't like letting that out much.  So the whole week I'm kinda stressin about wtf I said, and then I figured that musta been it.

So now I'm stressin like I thought atleast this chapter was super chill etc.  Like maybe I'ma have to choose between BACA and my gal, which as much as I'd like to say it would be an easy fuckin choice, BACA keeps me grounded.  Gives me a reason outside myself, a mission; and the brotherhood too.  Keeps me outpatient.

But then last weekend we had a barbecue at one of the board member's old man's place.  So while not a board member, definitely has pull in the chapter.  While there I ask my sponsor about it, as well as the pres, and they both say they didn't get any details, and if that was ""pushing my lifestyle"" not to worry about it.

Anywway the beer starts flowin.  Then they break out the cohiba's and the eagle rare (decent cigars and more than decent whiskey).  And then the shine.  Definitely a good time, I limited myself a whole lot (as in definitely woulda passed a breathalizer by the time I took off), as I took my bike but will likely uber the next barbecue.

So with a bit of liquid courage, I definitely opened up a bit more, the word partner comes up more than a few times in conversation, nobody in K chapter gives a shit.  Then at the end of the night, the host (the old man) pulls me a side.

""Hey, just lettin you know, you're partner's welcome here.""

""Even if they're trans?"" bit nervous but hopefully expectant, and happily surprised.

""I don't give a shit if they're a fuckin two headed martian, your partner's welcome here""

So damn, in the heart of texas I found a biker chapter me AND my partner can call home.

Just damn.

"Comfort and kindness of strangers Today as I was ready to board my flight home I got the devastating news that my niece, who has been fighting a very aggressive form of cancer, had passed.  All I could think as I made my way to my seat was 'just hold it together until you get to your seat.  Then you can cry.' As I made my way to my seat I saw that I would be sitting between 2 women who right away smiled at me and moved to let me in.  

As I slumped into my seat I couldn't control the tears that were welling  and I started to quietly sniffle and dab my eyes.  I noticed the woman on my right was wearing a mask so I wanted to let her know that my sniffling wasn't because I was sick.  As I choked out the words she saw my tears and asked if I was Ok.  I let her know I had just received the bad news about my niece and she immediately grabbed my hand and said how sorry she was. The woman on the other side did the same. 

These incredible women showed such compassion for me the whole flight. We  shared stories, tears and laughter for the next 5 hours until the flight landed. At the end of the flight we hugged and I thanked them for getting me through such a tough time.  

We didn't exchange names but I hope they see this and know how much the kindness of these strangers meant to me.  ",excited,wholesome
"Suit for a lifetime  Growing up in a low-income household, my parents made sure we always had the essentials we needed. In 1987, after graduating high school, I applied for a position at a local credit union and was thrilled to receive an invitation for an interview. However, I faced a challenge—I didn’t own a suit or any formal attire.

Understanding the importance of this opportunity, my mother took me to Mervyn's, where she generously bought me a jacket and slacks. Thanks to her support, I went into that interview feeling confident and hopeful, ultimately landing the job.

Fast forward to today, where I proudly hold a master’s degree and have a closet full of suits. Yet, despite my wardrobe upgrade, I still wear that first jacket, knowing how hard it was for my parents to afford it. Though it’s a bit snug now compared to when I first wore it, it remains my favorite—a cherished reminder of their sacrifices and the love that fueled my journey",excited,wholesome
"fucked up my first first aid, then came redemption  Tl:dr: fucked up my first first aid, then came redemption . 

I published this text the other day on another sub. Someone suggested I post it here. 
I hesitated because I don't want to put myself forward, but this story has an educational value and will undoubtedly inspire others to learn first aid and that's really what matters to me.


Every year, I do my first aid training at my company. I'd never used it before. 

And last year :

I was on my way back from a 10 km run and kind of depressed , I was driving along the beach road and there was a traffic jam. 

  
In front of me were two cars and a large camper van. I looked in my rear-view mirror and saw a motorbike quietly going up the side of the car (authorised in France), I looked ahead and saw that on the side of the camper van in a blind spot there was in fact a car in front of it that was about to make a U-turn. A recipe for disaster. 

By the time I turned to try and warn the biker it was already too late to avoid the accident. He must have been travelling at 40 km/h, the impact was quite violent. 

I rushed to his aid along with other people, alerted the fire brigade as is the case in my country and tried to get some information from him but in fact, as a motorcyclist myself, I was completely terrified by what had just happened. I couldn't talk to him, I was scared to see him die 

 I also lost my shit because, after the adrenalin of my race, I wasn't really in good shape, in short I was useless. 

  
I was asked to move my car, I saw that help was arriving, that he was surrounded by other people(but I was the only one knowing first aide procedures) and that I couldn't do any more, so I left.



For several weeks, I blamed myself terribly, I felt cowardly and useless.

Then one evening I came home to redemption. 

It was one o'clock in the morning, and I saw a little boy asking me for help, I was a bit puzzled it was very late, situation was odd, he insisted 'my little brother is very sick, I need help'.

  
 I asked where he was, he showed me the house and we rushed towards it, where I saw a family with 2 parents, 2 older teenagers, 2 younger children, the boy who had called me and, above all, a boy of about ten years old in the middle, convulsing or loosing consciousness. 

The family was terrified, and all the reflexes I've learnt came into play. 

I was no more a spectator, totally in control. Mother was on the Phone with the emergency services, but they were not able to understand her well. She had a strong african accent. I took the Phone and made a full report to the doctor on the Phone. He was obviously relieved to have someone calm and reliable. 

At the same time, I position the child, try to keep him awake and try to calm those around him, who are completely panicked. It took forever, but I didn't want to give up on the little kid. Then emergency services took over.

  
I was about to leave without saying anything when I saw that the two little 4 year olds, a boy and a girl, obviously twins, were staring at the firemen giving their brother first aid. So I organised a ball game at 1am with the two children. I wanted them to focus on something else. 

But that wasn't enough and in the end I offered the two children a big hug, they rushed into my arms, and stayed with them in my arms until the firemen left with their brother

  
The mum asked for my contact details and for 10 days I had no news and I didn't dare call for fear of bad news. 

In the end I got a call from Côte d'Ivoire; the little boy had spent a week in intensive care and had been able to return home. 

She was crying I saved her son, I was crying. I'm not at all sure that I saved the boy, I think I just helped a family wait for the real heros(firemen, doctors) , but I don't think I was too bad that night.

Afterwards, I told my instructor the whole story, which he now uses for his training courses. The idea is to remind people that we're trying to do our Best and that's more than 99% of the people.

About the biker, he had had several bones fractured but less serious than first thought and I still think I was shit that day",excited,wholesome

"A kind stranger paid for my food I  (19) am a student that attends a community college. My commute is about an hour and a half worth of driving (one way) so I'm usually up pretty early in the morning. Today, however, I was running late to school so I had a really small breakfast hoping I could eat something else on campus after I finished my first class. I made sure to pack about $15 in my bag (food here is pricey) before I left the house. So fast forward, my class is over and I'm absolutely starving. My friend suggests we go visit a tea/sandwich shop (cheaper than the actual campus food) down the road from the main campus building and I happily oblige. 

We go in, he orders first, and then it's my turn-- but when I go to pay, I realize my money is just gone. I'm shuffling through all the pockets in my bag, even turning my pants pockets inside out and it just wasn't there!! I even called my mom to ask her if I'd somehow left the money at home and still nothing. So I literally told the cashier to give me a moment and then I proceeded to take all the contents out of my bag onto a table so I could search. I vividly remembered putting the money in my bag. But now that I think about it, I did put it in the outer pocket of my bag so maybe it fell out or maybe someone pickpocketted me?? Regardless, I was panicking now because there's no way it just thanos snapped poofed into thin air.  

My friend offers to help me pay but I declined his offer because he's also a broke ass student and I just don't want to put any burdens on him. I tell him that it's okay and that we should get going to the main campus. By this point I've pulled out my phone and started scrolling because I'm on the verge of tears since everyone in the restaurant was just staring at me. My friend offers to pay for me again and I decline, telling him that I likely just left the money somewhere in the main campus and that I could search there. By this point my face was burning red with embarrassment and my eyes were so watery I couldn't see-- literally I was holding on by a thread to not burst out sobbing. But then suddenly the cashier tells me to take my food because someone had just paid for my order. 

So I look up at my friend and he seems just as surprised as I am. We look over to the counter and there's a man who looks like he's in his 40s, his arm is in a cast and he looks a little beat up but regardless of that there was just something about him that looked so...gentle? It's hard to describe it. It was just this look in his eyes that told me that it was all going to be okay. He said he had a daughter who was also a college student and he had seen her in a similar position before. He reminded me that this sort of thing happens to people all the time, especially to college students, and that I didn't need to feel ashamed. It was just such a huge relief that I couldn't help but cry like a child right there in the middle of the restaurant. 

I guess sometimes you just forget that people can be so loving and kind even to complete strangers despite all the hatred in the world. I got my food and I thanked him profusely on my way out, to which he smiled at me and he also handed me his business card!!(I respect the hustle) Turns out this guy is the manager of a high end restaurant in the downtown area. He said that I should bring my family along for dinner sometime and that we could catch up. Overall, quite the emotional whirlwind but now I'm back at my college campus eating a sandwich! I'm really touched by the actions of this kind stranger and I hope to one day be able to pay it forward. Thank you all for reading and have a nice day.",excited,wholesome

"‘No animosity between us’: Lungless frog finding retracted after 16 years"" TLDR: Dude discovers and catalogues new species of lungless frog. He even hypothesizes a novel model of frog metabolism. 

16 years later, his buddy kinda stumbles upon something rather critical to the scientific record: said frog does indeed have some absurdly tiny functioning lungs. 

WHOLESOME PART: 

> To be clear, David Bickford has been a colleague for many years, and there was no animosity between us about this paper. 

Our guy is going out of his way to make it clear that he wasn't going after his buddy. *I mean, we weren't even looking for lungs, but then we saw the lungs, at which point we were looking at the lungs, because, well there they were.

"Thank you for the painting, kind stranger from Goodwill. I appreciate it more than you know Shopping at Goodwill today, an older woman and I were both looking through the frames and paintings. I picked up and put down a canvas print several times; just couldn’t decide if I actually wanted it. I noticed she looked at it a few times too. 

Came back over a few minutes later; looked at the print again. She was nearby and said, “it is cool looking, isn’t it?” 
“Yes, it really is!” 
“Well I think you should go ahead and get it. It seems like you really like it! Plus if you don’t I will!” 

I am actually crippled by small decision making at times, especially for low-stakes things like this, and probably would not have gotten the painting then regretted it later. So I said, “that must have been my sign to get it. Thank you for the nudge, you’re very kind.” Just a sweet and genuine interaction. 

10 min or so later, someone came up behind me and looked at the painting in my cart— it was her, checking the price tag, and she quickly said, “Okay good, I want you to have this painting. I just really want you to have it.” and gave me the $5 it cost to buy. She must have immediately known that I really needed this act of kindness because we immediately hugged each other and both shed a tear. No other words, just waved and went on our way. Call me sentimental but I think our souls shared a momentary connection we could both feel through this small gesture. 

I will now have this beautiful memory in my head each time I look at the canvas in my home. That is worth so, so much more than $5. I wish I could tell her that and show her how wonderful it looks hung up, but that’s part of the beauty in these scenarios. ",excited,wholesome
"Hugs are such a beautiful thing  I have recently over the years been going through a really hard time quietly. Well my brother stopped in to town for a few days and saw a picture of how I have been. I have always been close with my family and when I hugged him goodbye I couldn't help but cry a bit. .

You know when you think the hug is over and make a move to release from the hug but they don't let go right away, so you hug them back more? It was one of the longest, deepest, most meaningful moments of my life. To feel so heard and loved by someone like that. We have always been close but never connected on such an intimate level. 

Since then I have started thinking about how much I have taken people in my life for granted. Hugs for granted. I have always found myself around friends and family that hug all the time and can share a vulnerable moment. Despite my mental health I am so happy to be around those who aren't afraid to be human. 

This marked a turning point (I hope). But all in all I just wanted this off my chest. There is love out there for us even if we don't love ourselves ",excited,wholesome

"My middle name matches my best friend again Years ago, I wanted to legally change my name since I came out as Nonbinary. I was going to change both my first and middle name, and had a first name picked out, but not a middle name. I gave a list of potential middle names to my best friend at the time, and she picked out “Ash” so that way it matched with her middle name “Phoenix.” I absolutely loved this idea, especially because I wanted to somehow show off the love I had for my best friend for getting me this far in life. 
Unfortunately, recently, my best friend abandoned me, and I was left distraught, heartbroken, and a bit betrayed. I also had an identity crisis, wondering who I was without her, especially because I used to love my name and now I hated it. Now my name was just a reminder of me being dedicated to someone who only saw me as temporary.
But, following this heartbreak, I started to hang out closer with my remaining friends and began to appreciate them more. I have a new best friend now, and I asked them what their middle name was. To my surprise, their middle name is “Gray”! That means my middle name still matches my best friend. I know this seems small and stupid, but I was absolutely elated to hear this. I can’t stop gushing over it.",excited,wholesome

i knew he would be my best friend when my parents tried to take away a raw bone and he growled at him, but i could take it and run or crawl all over him and he would never growl or bite.  whenever he hes scared and goes to growl at me he always licks me as an apology (even if its so grosssss), i know he always has my back even as a smart giant dog :)

he always protects the house, always protects me from scary amazon packages (i love them, he doss not lol) and he's truly a giant lap dog who still doesnt understand that he's over 120 lbs 😭

I didnt want it to end like this so today I just walked up to him at the grocery store (we never talk and barely know each other, we just say hello when we see each other there) and I asked him if I can ask him a question, he said sure, I asked him why he blocked me, he said bc I unfriended him, and then I explained to him and he asked if he should ass me again, I said sure or we just exchange numbers.

"My soulmate is my horse My mother raised me around hoses my whole life. When I came of age I bought my first horse at 18 years old. Her name is Ruby, a little red quarter horse, which so happens to be born in the same state I was in, same year and our birthdays are exactly 4 months apart. 

When I purchased Ruby I was in a really rough spot in life. I lost the relationship I had with my mother, I was going through a two year break up, I got really out of shape and my mental health was declining to the worst sate. I noticed Ruby hadn’t been treated like a pet, and more of a work horse, which made me sad. I could tell no one gave her genuine love and respect. 

Every time I would open her stall she would turn to hide in a corner and start to shiver. She was extremely head shy, and pretty much flinched at every movement I made. I could tell she just wasn’t mentally all there. I went to see her every day because I wanted her to learn I was going to be her person from now on. I spoiled her with treats and love. I respected her space and never did anything that caused her pain or discomfort. I never punished her for making a small mistake. I wanted to show her that I’ll always treat her with kindness and that she has me to rely on. For all the other horse people you’ll understand this kind of relationship. 

It took Ruby a couple years for her to trust me. She lets me come up to her while she’s laying down and during turn outs she likes to roll right next where I’m standing (for those who don’t understand, horses don’t lay down to people they don’t trust). She started neighing and perking her ears up whenever she would see me or call her name. I know she’s just a horse but me and Ruby had been on so many adventures and she helped me so much mentally. I feel like we needed each other. 

A year ago me and my current boyfriend started dating and of course he always adored Ruby. We recently found out we were expecting a baby. We were so excited and started preparing. But unfortunately I had a miscarriage and had to go to the hospital because I couldn’t stop bleeding. That night was so heart breaking and physically painful and exhausting, my boyfriend stayed with me the whole time. The next morning I wanted to go see Ruby with my boyfriend, I always go see her whenever I’m having a hard time. 

Usually when I turn her out she gets excited and starts bucking and running around as fast as she can. But that morning was different. When I turned her loose she didn’t leave. She stayed with her head low between me and my boyfriend. Which she never does, she usually likes her personal space. She followed us and didn’t leave us at all. She just had her head low , touching us with her face. it just kinda me me think, was she feeling the grief with us? Was she showing sympathy? Was she giving us comfort?. My boyfriend doesn’t understand horse body language that much but even he noticed her demeanor.

I consider this a wholesome moment because Ruby was there when I needed her to be. And I was there for her when she needed me. That morning made me realize this mare really has my back no matter what. I never had a horse comfort me the way she did, and after all these years she’s still one of the most important things to me. Me and Ruby are gonna turn 23 together soon, but in the near future, she’s the horse I want to raise my kids around like my mom did with me. ",excited,wholesome

Our son, who was four at the time, came to me one evening and gave me this card and told me to use it to keep my place in my book. At the time I was a folder LOL. Always folding down the corner of a page to keep my place. He told me it was a very strong Pokemon and it would work really good in my book. Of course at the time I knew nothing about Pokemon other than our son loved them.

Well I have used this card everyday for the past 22 years. I laminated it for the first time 2 years after he gave it to me because it was looking kind of rough lol. I have since re-laminated it many times.

Finding my soulmate  I just wanted to give hope to the people who are trying to date who are single and aren't having luck finding someone. I used to believe that I wouldn't find someone for me but now I know you just can't give up. I'm writing this while my wife is asleep. I'm a male and I'm slightly chubby. For years I've had problems find people to date because I'm shy I put up walls and can be sensitive. One day I was on Facebook dating and I had made a profile a while ago (at this time) and was getting ready to give up and delete my profile. I toke one last look through messages and matches and found this gorgeous girl. I was instantly amused by her pictures because there was no filters. We matched that day just an hour before I was going to delete my profile. I sent her a message and we talked until we fell asleep. The next day we started to video chat. I found out she was in mexico and I'm in the usa. I was so interested in her I didn't care plus she spoke English. After a week of talking she told me she was going to apply for a visa to come meet me. She paid everything and even was somehow got an expedited visa appointment so in 3 months she got her visa. At this point we was video chatting from the moment we got off work to when we went to sleep. She came and visited me and let me say the first time I saw her I knew I was going to marry her. I even joked with her that I was going to marry her before she came to the u.s. she shined so bright and just was all around amazing. For a while we would just meet up every weekend and spend time together. We even went on a 18 day camping vacation road tripping around to different locations roughing it without a  real shower for a few days. She has been absolutely amazing and we are so deeply in love still and we have a son now. I've never been shy with her we have a connection that goes beyond anything I've ever felt. I've cried in her arms and she is always there to say we can get through it together and in my heart I know it's true. I know she won't cheat we've both been cheat on. And the way she talks to her friends and family about it makes me feel special. I want to give hope that not women and not all men are bad just have to keep on truckin until you find that special person. I love my wife so much and there is times when we hold each other at night that I almost cried knowing I have someone like her by my side until I'm time on this world is over.

"I love it when someone learns my name This may sound silly, but this basic form of respect makes me genuinely happy, especially when kids do this. My name is rather unusual, since I’m Indian American. I got used to always needing to correct people, and that’s okay, but sometimes I wish I was given an easier name. I like my name though and wouldn’t know what name to use instead. 

Recently I took on a film project for a 12 year old girl, and I’m work friends with her mom. When emailing with her (the mom) she sent me a picture of something she found in her daughter’s work space. It’s just a little note that said my name, and that’s it. I don’t know what it’s for, but I assume she was going out of her way to learn my name, or something of that nature. I just think it’s so endearing when people go out of their way, especially kids. I genuinely like working with kids and always thought it was cute whenever they say my name (and look proud of themselves for getting it right). 

Another memory is associated with someone I’ve known for roughly a year. Whenever I first met him he told me he would avoid saying my name out loud in front of me because he didn’t want to get it wrong. Accordingly to him he would spend some time alone to practice pronouncing my name. While I personally don’t think my name is too difficult, I recognize that for some people it can be. I just think this is super cute, it makes me giddy, and I wanted to share this somewhere 😂",excited,wholesome

"Helped my elderly neighbor home Background info: My next door neighbors are in their 90s. Back in April, the gentleman was in a horrific car accident. He loved, but is in a nursing home due the accident messing up his brain to the effect of him thinking he was back in basic training. His wife was kind enough to put a lot of the neighbors on our street down as approved visitors. My husband has been taking their trashcan to the street and brought it back up for her. 

The lady stopped by to give us our mail, and I noticed she seemed a bit unstable. So I walked her back to her home. She's also in her 90s and she didn't have her cane. I got heat blisters on the balls of my feet because I was barefoot, but worth it! Being kind is my superpower. 😎

"Warms my heart In the last year or two, I’ve noticed that when my dad gets off of the phone with his friends, he says “I love you”. He’s a boomer who very much grew up with the expectation that boys are stoic and don’t show emotion. I always knew I was loved and he definitely showed me a softer side than most but this was largely true throughout my upbringing. My mom, his high school sweetheart, passed away suddenly and unexpectedly sixteen years ago. It rocked his world. I began spending any time I could with him to help support him in his new reality. Throughout the last sixteen years, he’s lost his twin brother and a large number of friends. He’s recently had a couple of friends get diagnosed with cancer. We were talking about it one night and he said he’s reached an age where someone you saw yesterday may not be here tomorrow and if he goes or they go, he just wants them all to know he loves them. And I think that’s the purest and most honest look into my dad’s heart and who he is and it just makes me love him more.",excited,wholesome

"Have a little laugh! These last two days I (28f) was horribly sick (still am but not as bad), now because of being sick I could not work and spent the whole 2 days in bed (or bathroom). My kids of course were with me right there the whole time with me lying in bed. I decided to watch some High School Musical (I know I know I feel the judgement LOL but deep down I love these movies). SO, we are watching the 3rd one and if you guys don't know it is about prom and graduation. Well, they are singing about prom and my son (9M) looks at me and asks, ""mom did you go to prom?"" I said ""yes, I did I went with a guy friend who is in the Navy."" My daughters (5F, 6F) looked with big eyes at me and go ""does that mean we can go to when we are older??"" I looked at them and said of course why wouldn't you?

I kid you not my son goes ""well did... that means you, did it?"" I got a little bit nervous/confused and asked, ""what do you mean by it?"" Then one of daughters (6F) goes ""well yea look they are doing it on tv"" Believe me I'm looking hard at the tv, at the background maybe there is something I did not catch all these years where I though these movies were innocent. I look at my son and go ""what do you mean it?"" my daughters are giggling at this point and son smirks and goes ""look at them they are kissing!"" I burst out laughing ""ooh that's what you mean"" (RELIEF all over!) I looked at my kids and said, ""you can go to prom and don't have to kiss anybody if you don't want to."" All of them go ""ohh we thought you had to kiss if you go to prom since that is what they are doing."" Then of course I explained to them they are kissing and going to prom because they are boyfriend and girlfriend.

"Hit and run? No, hit and wholesome. Want to share this wholesome interaction I had.

Today I had to leave for work at peak hour, it was school pick up hours. My street is extremely tight, cars are parked left and right. As I'm trying to squeeze through my car, cars just kept flying by. So, I waited for like 7 cars to pass through, it never ended and people started beeping. I took a chance and went forward but a car squeezed it's way in infront of me. I moved a little to the left and accidentally hit someone's side mirror and they beeped at me.

At this point my heart was pumping, I parked on the side and got out apologising over and over again, ready to exchange details, praying to God it's not going to be a horrible person.

They weren't, they were kind, assured me it's ok, nothing happened to the mirror and to just be careful when driving. I was baffled at this point, I kept asking ""are you sure? Are you sure??"" He smiled and said yes.

People like this deserve the world. Honestly I wish all good things come to people like this.

It's scary, trying to talk and get through it, especially when you are at fault is soooo damn terrifying. 

I was on my way to see my patient who has severe autism and was called by the parents on my day off to see him. I'm an occupational and speech therapist. This job is not easy but I love helping people.

"Kindness for homeless man becomes contagious :))) I truly doubted about posting this cause it could be seen as bragging... but Ive seen the butterfly effect its had, and I know I was inspired by other stories of acts of kindness. So, feeling very shy, here I go :) 

Last Tuesday I was walking around my block and I saw a sign taped to a wall: ""Dont leave stuff here, next time we will call the police"". It was in a place thats a bit protected from the elements and sometimes homeless people sleep there. 

I was so angry. What was wrong with people? It was in a part of the building that doesnt have car access, barely anyone passes, no doors close, I could not think of a reason anyone could care if someone slept there. The homeless people weve had in our neighbourhood never have caused any trouble, some have stayed for months and are quiet, respectful and *just want to be able to exist in peace*, dammit. 

I mulled over it all day. I told some neighbours, they got pissed too. I said I was going to put another sign, answering back. My neighbours (Jason) girlfriend (Mary) said, we should bring them something to eat! I thought it was a great idea! I couldnt at that moment, but we would do it in the evening. 

I am part of an urban vegetable garden, so I went to see if there was any fruits or veggies I could pick up from the common areas. I found my friend Grace there, told her the story, she sympatized a lot and helped me gather fruits, small branches of grapes that were still left on the vines from the past harvest. I thanked her so much, I wouldnt have found so much without her help. 

Jason and Mary couldnt go that day in the end, so I went alone to where the sign was. I found 3 people close and I politely asked if theh knew what the sign was all about. One of them said it was cause of him... he had left some clothes there. He kept em in some bushes now. I must have gotten an angry face cause he said it was okay, he didnt mind keeping em in the bushes. 

I told em some neighbours were very mad at the situation, and showed him two signs:
- One, for the wall: ""Is it really that difficult to have compassion for someone who doesnt have a refuge? If theyre not creating trouble, littering, or leaving around objects that could hurt pets or children, what is the problem? If it hurts your sighr so much, give them a curtain.""
""To whoever put this sign: I hope karma never leaves you in a situation when you have to carry your sleeping bag all day with you for fear of it being stolen. To whoever felt mensced by this sign: not all of us neighbours hate you. You are people and deserve to be treated as such:. 

- A second one, in the bag with food I brought: ""A loving reminder that not all neighbours despise you. Im not the only one that despised that sign. At least as far as Im concerned, and no matter how long or short of a period you stay here, as long as were all civic, respectful and safe, WE ARE NEIGHBOURS. These are some fresh fruits, picked this afternoon, i Hope you enjoy them"".

The man, and his friends (kids that lived in the block and apparently had known this person for years with no problem) were so touched. He took the note and put it with so much care inside his backpack. We hugged, then I remembered (duh) to ask for his name! And I realized I had seen him before! His name is Emilio. I gave him a bit bottle of cold water and some canned food last August. Hes very nice and polite. 

He told me some neighbours had been throwing trash at him from the upper windows, even water... trying to make him leave. My blood boiled. He was actually very understanding. Apparently, a year ago someone else had put a bunch of clothes where he was sleeping, put gasoline on them and set em on fire. He understood people could have gotten scared... he was taking it all with so much grace and understanding, I dont think I would have been capable. Apparently the person who put the original sign came to talk to him, apologized and gave him a coffee. But didnt take the sign off. And also, people were *throwing stuff at him*. I hanged my sign right next to the other one.

The wonderful thing... is that the next day Grace, my vegetable garden friend, called me. Told me she had been so sad about that sign, she had cooked several meals for this man, but she was in a rush, could I go pick em up and give them to him? OF COURSE!!!! There was actually so much that I gave him half and kept the other half in my fridge to give him some days later 😅

But my neighbours Jason and Mary still are going to bring him something to eat, they bought some melons. And yesterday I told the story to my dad... and when I mentioned Emilio putting so lovingly the note I gave him in his half-broken backpack, he stood up saying he was sure he had some backpacks somewhere he wasnt using and it could help!

And... one sign brought another. My idea of the sign brought Marys idea of food, which I borrowed. Then Grace upped that two orders of magnitude xD then my dad got invested too. 

And all of us could have looked at the sign and said nothing, or heard the story and do nothing... but this week, Emilio woke up to a menacing sign- and by the end of it, he has received fruits, toilet paper, a water bottle, some plastic, easy to transport cutlery, food for a whole week (Jesus, Grace xD) and when I go to see him again hell receive 2 new backpacks and a suitcase (my dad insists I give him all options to choose, or for him to keep all). 

And... it kinda makes my heart sing! ^^ Years ago I wouldnt have had any idea what to do. Ive seen so many videos of people just, extending kindness, that the idea of letting know (whoever it was, I didnt know I knew the man already) that they were respected came to my mind. I know seeing that kind of content inspired me, and started a chain of events.

So I really dont want this to be ablut me- its about Emilio. It could be about Grace cause, damn, I only wanted to have a small detail with whoever it was, but she must have cooked for hours (spent time, ingredients, containers), and even asked me where he was in case another day she brought more xD 


But mostly, I wanna share in case this inspires someone, like other content inspired me in the past 🥰

"My little snuggle bug. This is my girl Hazel. She's 10+ years old and was a rehome, her previous owner wasn't able to care for her anymore.

Hazel came to me in a rough time, I had just been through some pretty serious family problems and I was so depressed and agoraphobic that I could barely get out of bed in the morning. So, she would lay with me in bed, not snuggled up like she does now, but enough to let me know she's there. She helped me heal.

I've been in and out of multiple relationships, some of which being toxic and abusive. During those, she wouldn't as much as get onto the bed to cuddle. I couldn't understand why. However- now that I'm with my husband, pregnant and in a much better and SAFER space, I understand.

She picked up on everything. Even when I didn't see it, she picked up on my stress. My anxiety. My depression. Yes she did what she could to help me, but danger is danger. She had to keep herself safe to help keep me safe. 

Now that I'm in this safe space, where I'm happy and healthy and in a loving relationship, she not only snuggles (UNDER THE BLANKETS!!!!) with me, but will fall asleep with me, as well as my husband. 

Through all of the stress, the struggles, the chaos... She has helped me heal. 

Through death, and abuse, she has always been my light on the other side.

And now, my reward for all of the hardships, all of the struggles...

Is snuggles.

Thank you Hazel, I truly do not deserve you, but I appreciate and love you endlessly. 🥰",excited,wholesome
"i didn’t know life could be like this just a short story about how i (22F) rediscovered a happiness i didn’t know could exist beyond childhood within a group of 9 people (21-29F) i met through enjoying the same music. 

when i was in high school i didn’t have any friends. i was in an abusive relationship and the person i was dating cheated on me with all my friends and turned them all against me to isolate me. after i got a protection order against him and people began to realize that i wasn’t who he made me out to be, i slowly started trying to forgive everyone so i wouldn’t have to be without friends anymore. but it still hurt and no matter how much i tried to forgive, the ways that every single one of them hurt me always stuck with me. i wondered all the time “will life always be like this? will i ever find a TRUE friendship, someone who really loves and cares about me?” i always wondered why i was the odd one out and what was so wrong with me that everyone always hurt me as badly as they did. i wondered if i was doing something wrong or if i was the problem since i was the common denominator in everyone fucking me over all the time. i felt so alone and came to accept the fact that that was just how friendships were supposed to be. 

even after high school i struggled to find good friends. getting into all of the things i went through would take a long time but to sum it up, i was hurt more and more again and again and i lost all hope that id ever be happy. i told myself my expectations were too high and that backstabbing and being fucked over was just going to be a part of any friendship i had. 

and then i met them. 

a group of friends who shine as bright as the sun and are as welcoming as the waves touching the shore. they’re all genuinely good people. every. single. one of them. i was hesitant at first because i simply couldn’t believe it. but as time went by i started to slowly let my guard down. i can vent with them, i can laugh with them, i can talk to them about everything and nothing. a conversation about the walk someone went on or their day at work, a scrambled mess of screams and giggles over a kpop idol edit, a somber night full of venting and ranting our troubles away, and at the end of the day we’re all still there. together and united. we all love and care for each other and there is no fighting, no talking behind each others backs, no aggressiveness or backstabbing. we all have understanding and compassion for each other. i think because of how much suffering i went through in order to find my way to them, it makes me eternally more grateful every day to have them in my life. it genuinely blows my mind every single day that these people actually exist and im lucky enough to have found them in my life. they made me realize that good people do exist in the world. i don’t go a single day without thinking about how i managed to win the lottery. i am so absolutely absurdly rich with love. i didn’t know life could be like this. 

i used to wonder what i did to deserve so much pain and so much hurt from the people i loved. and now i wonder what i did to deserve so much love and kindness from the best people ive ever been fortunate enough to meet. 

i think this is how life is supposed to be ",excited,wholesome
"Adult female friendships are the bedrock of self-worth and are the most wholesome gift someone can offer you… It’s hard to bounce back from tough times. Sometimes it takes so much out of you that there’s not much of you left anymore. I went through hell and am coming to terms with my own self-perceived  inadequacies to be able to look at them without shame and self directed prejudice. For me, lost love is one part of it but a lifetime of diminished self-worth is the main problem.

"Launched boyfriend in a cute way I (24F) just wanted to share that I still feel proud of how I launched my boyfriend (25M) to our friends when there was no soft or hard launch on social media platforms.

It was an enemies to lovers story. I, and my now ex-boyfriend, used to fight, make fun of or just piss each other off quite publicly. Eventually, we got to talking one day and the rest, as they say, was history. We were a part of a group of 8 to 10 people so our friends were mostly mutual. Given our history, we were the ""least expected to be a couple"" amongst us. We had started dating in private and after having gone steady for a couple months, it had started getting harder to hide the fact that we were dating, especially when we had to play fight to keep up the pretense. We were young and in love and quite impatient. Finally, we had decided that we would tell our friends the truth.

The reveal: I told my friends early in the morning that I had started seeing someone. There were rounds of disbelief and exclaims of ""you're lying"" because I had never even mentioned that I had been talking to anyone. I told them I have proof i.e. he would be coming to pick me up after our classes ended for the day. And that they could just meet him then. Classes end, day's over, we head downstairs and out towards the main entrance. Walking amidst a chorus of ""where is he?"", ""when is he coming?"", ""are you sure you're not lying to us?"" etc, I pointed out to the main entrance of our campus and said he will be coming in any minute now resulting in the entire group focusing on the entrance (and occasionally, them pointing out to random strangers with ""is this him?"") while my and boyfriend and I just stood there giggling at their (to us) silliness. While they were all busy doing that, I held my boyfriend's hand and waited for anyone to turn around and notice us. And lo and behold, they did.

The reaction: Each one of our friends was in shock and were in complete disbelief. Some were speechless while others were saying that we were pranking them. All in all, it was a very funny way to launch my boyfriend and... I don't know, I just feel it was a very quirky way to introduce someone to the group and basically pull one over on the people who claimed to know us so well and yet we could hide something so (felt like at that time) big. We felt proud \^\_\^

P.S. Still on good terms with this ex-boyfriend.",excited,wholesome

"Plushies are for dads too! * TLDR: I try to always bring a plush for my dad to play with when I drive him and he genuinely loves it. Today Lemon joined us for the drive *

My dad takes care of my grandma’s 3x a week since she became paralyzed because caretakers will only come out Monday-Thursday. He used to take the bus until I asked him if I could transport him instead. He often was so exhausted that he didn’t have much to say during our drives other than thanking me for the ride… until recently! 

I decided a while ago that I was going to start bringing plushies and crochet projects to spark conversation. I would bring a new squishmallow find, he would squish it and ask what their names are. I would start crocheting a sweater for a squishmallow and he would ask how it’s coming along. He even keeps an eye out for squishes at stores for me now and got me a little squishmallow for my birthday lol.

I got a new pig plushie, so today I set her in my dash for the drive. He grabbed her to pet her belly and then started looking at her tush tags for a name because he assumed she would have one like squishmallows lol. I let him know I named her Lemon, which made him smile.

So since it’s Father’s Day, I’m just here to spread the message that dads like plushies too! I’m currently trying to crochet him a plush that looks like his dog and he keeps asking for updates lol. I think we should get all of our dads hooked on plush collecting 🤷🏻‍♀️",excited,wholesome

"Wholesome Moment of Solidarity I Had I'm disabled, relevant to this story.
I had just started 10th grade in High School, transferring from another school, and this was the first year at this school that they had banned cell phones during class. 
I had a free block one day and was sitting at a table in a hallway intersection, I had above-standard grades and nothing to do, and because the school never covered phone use rules during free block, I didn't know I was breaking rules, ironically I was reading a book and doing something educational. 

The Vice Principal passes through and confiscates my phone and that of a student I'm sitting across from, neither of us knew that phone use wasn't allowed in free blocks. 

Thing is was that I need my phone for accessibility, the VP didn't take my explanation though (*ableism and ignorance whoop whoop!*), and the person across me was struggling to explain. 

After the principal was gone, I had put together why the student across from me hadn't explained, he didn't speak English. 
I asked what language he spoke and determined he only spoke Portuguese and had immigrated from Mozambique, using my laptop to translate, I learned he was using and needed his phone to actively translate people speaking English in the room, I told him my situation and how I needed my phone for accessibility reasons, and we both sympathised and became quick friends!

Together we ended up going down to the front desk and I helped interpret so that we could negotiate and explain why we needed our phones for linguistic and disability accommodations and were able to get our phones back. 

Just a wholesome moment of in-situ allyship and solidarity between two oppressed demographics I still remember to this day.",excited,wholesome
"Best compliment ever given Last week was my youngest sons birthday. We went out to our favorite kids themed museum and I was hoping to find us somewhere different to eat for dinner. We weren't having much luck because it was a Friday night and the city was packed. Finally found somewhere and it still was another 30 mins before we got a table so by then we were all fussy, tired, and hungry. At this point I'm just hoping we can get some food and everyone enjoy the end of the night. 
We finally get our food and everyone's super happy with it all. I was especially surprised the oldest was into his food. He's usually picky with new places to eat. We're all talking about the day and how we like this restaurant, when he says ""I love this place the food is great but your foods way better"" (talking about my food). 
When I tell you I was smiling so big and almost felt like crying, I'm serious. He can be hard to please when it comes to food and hearing him say this out of the blue was one of the best compliments I've ever recieved in my life. ",excited,wholesome

9 months ago today I started dating a friend who I have known for like 6 years. 
The guy I saw before him just wanted the benefits of dating without the commitment, and I didn't realize it until I had already spent like 300 dollars or something for a plane ticket to go see him for a week. (Note I knew him from high School and I had a crush on him them..guess I stil did) I won't get into details but all he wanted was (you know) and that was the first time I had been with a guy.. 4 months into talking to him I realized I deserve better, so I ended it. 
A year later I asked out a long distance friend and 6 months ago in April he paid for my plane ticket to see him and now I'm moving in with him and his family... I'm so happy.. my home life wasn't the best.. I spent four years on a couch in the living room and now I have a room of my own and a house full of people who love and support me. 

I know I'm still young but he has straight up told me he plans on asking me to marry him some day. And our year anniversary is in December, and he has even talked to my parents about a surprise he has for me. 


-update-
So a few weekends ago me, him and his mom drove back to my home state to get the rest of my things and it was so good to see some of my family and friends. My grandma straight up said ""he's so good to you, I feel so much more at ease with you being there now"" and my uncle (who's like a second dad to me) already likes him. 



-update-
So as of today I am now engaged!!!",excited,wholesome
"The valedictorian from Glasgow High-school (Delaware United States) came to America 4 years ago from Mexico without the command of the English language. “At age 15, Enrique Flores-Lopez left his family in Mexico and moved to Delaware, where he enrolled in Glasgow High School.

‘My father worked hard to earn his American citizenship. It was the greatest gift gave me before he passed away,’ Flores-Lopez, explaining that he made the hard decision to move here because he ‘wanted to make the most of my American citizenship.’

He struggled with the language barrier and culture shock, but he preserved and on Sunday addressed his classmates as the valedictorian. Accepted to 17 colleges with more than $2 million in scholarship offers, he will attend the University of North Carolina on a full-ride academic scholarship.”

"I have a pigeon couple that live in my garden Roughly around late fall / early winter of 2023, I found an injured pigeon hopping around outside my front door. It was clear he had hurt his wing as he couldn’t fly and it was a really cold and windy evening. I named him ‘Peter the Pigeon’  and I made up a little shoe-box bed with some bird feed and water, put Peter in the bed and took him inside our garage for the night (we have two bird-loving cats inside!). He was still there in the morning and eventually left some point in the late morning and I was just happy to help out a little guy in need. 

Well, maybe a month later or so I noticed a pigeon that would chill out on my garden fence pretty much every single evening and I’d joke that it was Peter. Not long after that this same pigeon would always be joined by another pigeon, which I called ‘Pam the Pigeon’ and they would regularly mate on my fence lmaooo. 
The time passed and Spring came, Peter and Pam had made a nest in the tree in my garden and they had babies! I’d always watch them going back and forth from their nest and even got to see the whole process till the babies left the nest. Peter and Pam are still here everyday and last week I saw them setting up (or repairing?? idk) another nest in the same tree so i’m hoping for some new baby pigeons!! 
They’re still wild pigeons of course and behave accordingly, but I feel like we’ve built somewhat of a level of trust because i’m able to stand right underneath them when they’re on the fence and they won’t fly away. 

Anyways I thought i’d share the story of the pigeon couple, Peter and Pam for everyone :) ",excited,wholesome

"My art got stolen by 1000s of online shops so I sued them and bought an apartment with the money 6 years ago my art was stolen by 1000s of online shops. They printed my art on all kinds of products and sold them everywhere around the world. They made millions from it. I even saw people wearing my art on the street and saw it at markets and souvenir shops on vacation.

I tried to fight the theft by myself but gave up because it became too overwhelming. For every counterfeit item I got to remove, ten new ones popped up.

Then 2 yrs ago I started working with a law firm. 16 lawyers took down over 2000 shops to this date & recovered funds. They said it was the biggest case of art theft they have ever had to deal with and they’re still working on it!

After almost giving up and at some point even wanting to quit art, I just bought my own apartment with the money my lawyers recovered so far!

"Finally saved up to surprise my girlfriend with everything she's ever wanted! 
To start, my girlfriend has had one kf the hardest starts to life, and has never been able to get the things she's wanted, having had things on her wishlist for 6+ years and never looking like she could ever afford them.

Recently her work has been going well enough she can support herself and she's started saving. I have been meanwhile working endless over-time and night shifts to work as hard as I can. We are long distance and in different timezones so it hasn't affected our reletionship much.

Recently we found her her trip to see me and meet my family isn't looking possible for her, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to surprise visit her for a couple of weeks. I organised flights and where to stay, even contacting some of her friends and sisters to help me with organisation. 

In the lead up I thought since I had been working so hard and saving, it would be perfect timing to get her all the things she wants and truly make this the biggest and best surprise ever.

I've bought her some Gucci shoes she has wanted forever but are staggeringly expensive so never did, a loose certified diamond as she collects gemstones, 3 gold rings of varying colours and gemstones as she loves rings and wanted more, a totem that is significant to her culture, a locket with a photo of her dog that Recently died, and a few other small things.

These are all items she's longed for, for such a long time. Being able to get her all these and surprise her in her own country is one of the most exciting things I've ever experienced jn my entire life, I love her so much and the thought of how happy she will be makes my heart race.

Thank you for reading my ramble, I'm just so happy she can finally get the things she wants.",excited,Happy

"I overcame a multitude of struggle areas today, all without getting majorly lost, panicking, or breaking down! I *SEVERELY* struggle with public transport, I get incredibly disoriented, I get really overwhelmed with all the platforms, stations, different trains/busses, the announcements, all the people, the noise, everything. Every time I have had to take a train in the past, especially by myself, things don't go very well and I typically breakdown at least once

But I had to go to a physio appointment today that was 3 hours and 14 minutes away by walking (at least according to Google, I did in in 2 hours and 20 minutes). And while I walked there, I knew I couldn't manage walking back, so I bit the bullet and took the trains. Originally it wanted me to take both trains and buses, but I found a route that was only trains, taking a train and bus was too much for me

I had to go on 3 different trains, and though I got lost at the first change over, but I didn't panic, I stayed calm, and I went up to someone and asked for help! And yeah! I did it! I stayed calm the whole time, and made it back home without incident! For me today has been very successful! I walked all the way to the hospital without getting lost, and I managed the walk. I did my physio appointment and managed to do that. I then took the trains back home. I managed to talk to a stranger to ask for help. And I did it all without panicking or getting over stimulated and breaking down! I am very tired now, I did nearly 22k steps today, but I am proud of my accomplishments today! I managed multiple tough areas for me! I saw baby coots and a wild pheasant on my walk :3",excited,Happy

"Moved to Asia to connect to my roots, unexpectedly and absolutely fell in love with the chaos! I’m Indo-Australian—my mom is Indonesian, my dad’s Australian—and I grew up in Canberra, feeling somewhat disconnected from my Indonesian side. As a kid, it was hard to find an identity for myself. I wasn’t fully white, but I wasn’t completely Asian either. I got curious looks and questions like “Where are you really from?” because I didn’t fit neatly into either box. That confusion followed me through my teenage years, and I often felt like I didn’t quite belong anywhere.

A little over a year ago, I decided to move to Jakarta to reconnect with my roots, learn the language, and see what life’s like here.

I honestly thought it’d be a short stay, just to dive into my heritage, but Jakarta surprised me. The chaos, the warmth, the affordability, the vibe—I started building a life, made friends, explored every corner of the city… and then my boyfriend joined me a few months in, and it’s almost been a year for him too now.

One thing I’ve noticed is how different people are here compared to Australia. In Australia, the vibe is often laid-back and casual—everyone’s generally more reserved and not super into showing emotions. But here in Indonesia, people are incredibly warm, open, and family-oriented. There’s this strong sense of community, and it feels like everyone’s really connected, whether it’s through their traditions or just everyday life. At first, the directness was a bit of a shock, but I’ve grown to love how people really see each other here. It’s a refreshing change from the more independent, private Aussie mindset.

Jakarta isn’t perfect—traffic is wild and it’s humid 90% of the time—but it’s alive. There’s art, music, community, late-night food, and this constant buzz that keeps things interesting. For any other third culture kids or people thinking of “visiting” their roots—I can’t recommend it enough. You might end up finding more than you expected! :))",excited,Happy

"Happy (and sad) dad moment this evening. My son officially told me he’s too old to hold my hand. Naturally, I responded with grace and maturity. (Just kidding.I contemplated crying into a bowl of Goldfish crackers.)

But then, without missing a beat, he said he’ll never be too old to make up rap lyrics about ketchup, mustard, and other random things we come up with at any given moment.

And just like that, my dad heart was both devastated and completely fulfilled.

Guess it’s time we get serious about our first EP. Working title: ""Beats & Burgers: The Lunchbox Sessions.""

Moral of the story? Joy sneaks in. Even when you’re feeling all the feels, and even when your kid is growing up too fast.

Hold tight to the weird and wonderful, especially the mustard-fueled bars.

"Letting out my secret here so I don’t ruin the surprise  I'm planning on soon flying to France to meet the love of my life for the first time. This isn't the surprise. we are both working very hard together as a team for months to make this happen.

The surprise is that he has no idea that i'm going to give him a gift. It's a custom little leather notebook engraved with a world map with hearts in both of our countries and a dotted line connecting them. I'm planning on adding some cute little personalized artwork, writing, and map cutouts inside representing our journey. He's a huge map nerd, so I think he absolutely is going to adore it!!!

What makes this so special to me is just how hard i've worked to make this happen. We both had not the best lives filled with many challenges, to put it lightly. This isn't just a love story, but a part of my own. I went from someone who was mute, anorexic, unable to even step a single foot outside of my house due to  disabling mental health conditions, to somebody who has faced some of my biggest fears (such as getting a job in retail), takes good care of my body, and am truly now see life through eyes of optimism and hope. I did this all on my own, but my soulmate was my inspiration that helped give me the inner strength to make all of this happen. 

Never in the world have I ever would've thought I would be living such a fantastical reality such as this... But here I am. Life truly is beautiful.",excited,Happy

"My employee told me (platonically) that he loves me That's it, really. 

It's just the two of us at this little plumbing company that I started last year, and we have both suffered tragic/unexpected loss recently. Sounds funny, but it feels like we've been taking turns keeping the other strong when those hard days hit. 

We were chatting before heading to separate jobs on Monday morning, and he closed with ""I love you, man.  I hope you know that"", and has been ending some phone calls with a casual ""Love ya"".

It's just nice, and it made me happy. That's all.

"Not a involuntary celibate anymore Finally did it after lots of patience Not an involuntary celibate anymore

Hello folks,
I hope it's not my last post though i thought that many months back.
I'm not going to give you the context of this post because it's easier to go to my feed and read my posts gives me all the mystery and efforts to know about isn't it?.
So I was in this god forsaken place spamming my internal lonely thoughts every hour seeking attention or maybe someone to talk to.
Broke financially and mentally but somehow physically fit due to my drunken gym sessions early mornings.
I was here all the time seeking attention or chatrooms online.
Some said they are in love with me that too one claimed to collect money to visit my country through part time p***titution another one was a trans woman not able to understand I'm straight and bullying me afterwards , and few men roleplaying as girls and a moody middle aged lady.
All these things i don't know why and what I was doing.
Things changed when I got a job and moved to a new city.
Looked promising with new job and place.
At first i got attention of women due to me having a tall and lean physique and smoldering looks.
Then these things just faded and the past started catching up.
I started drinking and sulking again, started to miss work and what not.
I thought I was never going to seek love online.
But destiny had another plans.
I joined a book club and I'm not going to mention platform.
There I met a girl who spoke very little but very beautiful.
I was lucky that she loved to read and i love to write.
Slowly my wordplay got up to her and in a month or so she confessed that she likes me.
Long calls , texts and gifts from her be it flowers , chocolates , books and even a meal when I used to hungry.
After alot of uncertainty from her side i finally went to meet her travelling miles and taking off from work.
It was a weekend, summer days and a dreamy Airbnb in a costal city and good food and vibes.
She came to my Airbnb in the morning and used to stay until dark.
In between we would do what couples are supposed to do inside a dreamy Airbnb all alone.
I would move around without clothes around her and she would treat me normally.
Lots of moments in those days.
Cuddles , hugs , kisses and whatnot.
Felt surreal and hours felt like minutes.
Felt like I was in some kind of rom-com.
I was not here to share my story.
I was just here to say when you have your bad days just tell yourself it will pass and it does eventually with lot's of waiting and hope.
It's absolutely never perfect but you will have peace and greatfullness of whatever you have and you have paid your dues.
I have a long way to go and alot to do.
So i rarely sulk thinking my life is over.
But I count my blessings everyday.
And I'm very thankful to God.
I'm just posting here to tell all those online bullies that I'm not a Involuntary celibate anymore.
And i have no hate in my heart.

Thanks 
Travis.",excited,Happy

It was the hardest thing I’d ever done. While I loved the event I hated how hard it was for me, I hated that I’d let it become so hard, and I really hated the photos.

Truth is I hated most things about me.

"I bought food for a stranger today and I feel good about it. Here is why. (For context me and the stranger are both women and we were both customers.) I went to McDonalds for the 2nd night in a row. The first night there was a woman there who I honestly did not pay much attention to at first until she started to talk to me.

She saw me and my son (20 months old) and told me ""His outfit is cute."" I said ""Thank you."" And I noticed she kept staring at us.

The next night when I went to McDonalds again I saw that same woman. It took me a second to recognize her. I kept staring at her to see if she really was the same woman from yesterday. I also noticed that she looked really sad this time. I also started to realize that both of the nights that I saw her she was not eating anything. Then she noticed me staring at her and then she waved at me (I guess she recognized me too) and then I just impulsively asked her ""Do you want something?"" As I was pointing at the front counter. Then she said ""Are you sure?"" I said ""Yes."" Then I walked up to her table and asked her what she wanted. She said ""I guess either a chicken sandwhich or chicken nuggets."" Then I went up to the counter and ordered her the 10 piece nugget meal. Then the cashier asked me what kind of sauce. Then I looked at the stranger I was ordering for and said ""What kind of sauce do you want?"" Then she said ""Ranch."" Then after I was done ordering for her I handed her the cup that came with her order along with the reciept. (mcdonalds was still in the process of making her food and handed me the cup before the rest of the order was ready). I immediately left the restaurant after I bought her the food and handed her the cup and reciept. I never told her my name. Idk why. 

I felt like she was either homeless or at least very poor. Or maybe she was just sad maybe she was waiting on someone who ditched her. I have been homeless before and I guess she kind of reminded me of myself. ",excited,Happy

"My daughter bought a Chase Mullen print for me! I love his artwork after seeing his first solo exhibit in Baton Rouge.  They really struck me.  There were two prints in the giftshop at the museum, but I was on vacation and didn't want to be carting around expensive prints, flights and stuff, and figured I get them online when I got home.  NOPE!!  I searched for days and they were totally sold out and the museum wouldn't ship them.

So far, I had bought 4 of his signed and numbered prints, one of them is hand embellished by the artist and there are only 10 of them.

Anyway, she came over on Mother's Day and gave me a bag of various goodies, beauty, hair and skin stuff.  Chase had just released two new signed and numbered prints and I bought one of them, Chasin Rainbows (top left).  It's already sold out.  I told her that I was only getting one because things are a little tight at the moment.

Well, she texts me later that she bought the other one, Riverboat (the alligator), for me!  My heart does a little flip every time I think of it.  Can't wait to see them in person.

"After 9 months of exhausting work and lonely nights, I just opened my dream store with my art!! ✨️😭🥳🥰🙏✨️ Please celebrate with me because this has been one of the most demanding, intense, and challenging developments ever! Last year, I overcame the struggle of unemployment and food insecurity and got a job in, of all places, the Empire State Building! (That was actually my last post here lol.) The job allowed me to get above survival for the first time in my adult life and fall asleep in peace - a dynamic that evaded me for years - especially during the pandemic. 

While it was a massive relief to have a regular paycheck, it still wasn't enough to really thrive, especially because of cost of living increases, inflation, you name it. I also had almost no time to paint and began searching for a way to self-express and develop my art while pressured from a day job. I shared my story with one of the interns who wanted to meet to see if we could work together to build a project on the side. ""I've always wanted to have a client,"" she said. ""I love consulting!"" 

A few days later, we met in a coffee shop, opened our laptops, and I shared my ideas for taking the art that got me through the pandemic and turning it into a store; a space that would offer products with my art on it. Neither of us knew what we were getting into. I certainly had no background, knowledge, or expertise in starting or running a business like this. All I knew how to do was.....paint 🥲. 

That initial meeting turned into another, and then another, until I had chosen a manufacturer and secured a website. Next came the designs. This part took months because it was necessary to choose which products to offer. What did people like? I had no idea. What should the prices be? Again, no idea. The worst moment came one afternoon when I had finished uploading all 200 designs. The manufacturer messaged me to say an error occurred with the final product. I figured it was just a technical glitch. Nope. All 200 products were designed and uploaded incorrectly, meaning they all had to be redesigned with the 'correct' DPI (dots per inch.) I fell to the floor in exhausted frustration. Weeks upon weeks of work, useless.🫠

It had to get done though, so I stood up after drying my tears and got back to work on product number 1 of 200. Several weeks later, they were done - thankfully, correctly! And after weeks of calls and emails and research, shipping and rates were settled. I couldn't afford to hire models, but my friends stepped up to the challenge by volunteering to help. Their empowerment has made all the difference in the world (you'll see some of them in the pics, with their consent given) and this was only possible because of their empathy, solidarity, and decency. 🫂

My hope is that this post and these words encourage you to pursue your goals, align with your vision, and most importantly, to push through the hardship - whatever form that takes for you - because you deserve to be happy. Even if you have to start from 1 out of 200 all over again, and even if you have no idea how it's going to happen, you can do it because your happiness is worth it.

Have a great week and thank you for reading about my journey. Sending joy and strength to those who need it ✨️🙏✨️ You got this!! ",excited,Happy

The first time around, it was tough, but this time I’m finding it a lot easier to stay on track. I’ve noticed more energy, clearer skin, and a better sense of overall well being. It’s not always easy, but it’s so worth it. I’m excited to see where this journey continues to take me!

* We went out to get dessert after dinner and we had a young lady ask us some questions about working as a firefighter, we spoke about what is involved and how we are always looking for more women to join the brigade.

"A Teacher’s Visit After Years Filled My Home — and Heart — with Love There are so many people who come into our lives and leave beautiful impressions.  
They don't have to be your partner or best friend.  
Just simple people, whose simple actions leave a deep impact on your life.

I want to share one such story.

Yesterday, my old tutor visited us. She taught me from Grade 1 to Grade 5.  
In the country where I live, private tuition is common — students go to a tutor's home or office and learn in small groups from different schools.  
So I started going to her when I was in Grade 1. She was very strict, yet loving. My mom always thanked her for helping me excel in academics. Once, my mom even invited her to my birthday party — she usually declined such invites, but she came that year.

After Grade 5, I moved to another tutor since she only taught till Grade 5. But I met her several times on the road over the years, and we’d talk.

Yesterday, after many years, she came to our home. She’s moving to Dubai with her daughter and wanted to see ""what her baby is doing in life.""  
She had also tutored my younger brother, who hasn’t been doing so well academically and has picked up some unhealthy habits. When she learned about it, she scolded him out of concern. But later, she spoke to him with love, asked him to promise that he'll start making better choices in life. It was such a warm moment.

I teared up twice just seeing her again. Before she left, she hugged me tightly. We exchanged phone numbers, and I told her I’ll come to visit her one day.

This quote reminded me that Yes she really shaped me into the person that I am today beyond just teaching subjects and I am very grateful

“Children are humanity in the making. What a teacher makes of them when they are in their hands is one of the greatest responsibilities and privileges a human being can have. Teaching should not be a profession – it must be a passion. Only then can education move from imposition of facts to exploration of truth.” – Sadhguru     

TLDR:  

My childhood tutor visited me after years, and her words still moved me. She cared, guided, and even now, she met her before moving out of the country

"Appreciation Post - my amazing Husband and my diabetes! Just wanted to share how amazing my husband is when it comes to my diabetes

I’ve been type 1 diabetic for almost 10 years now, and I’ve been married to my husband for 2. We live with his parents and sister, so they obviously know about my diabetes, but no one else in his extended family does.

Despite that, he goes above and beyond for me. He’s learned what to do when I’m high or low, helps me work out my insulin doses for meals and corrections, and if my CGM alarm goes off at night and I sleep through it, he’ll wake me up and check I’m okay.

When we go out, he always has sugar on him — even when I forget mine — and he keeps emergency snacks in the car just in case. He’s even gone out and bought me stuff like cooling bags for my insulin without me asking.

Managing type 1 can be overwhelming sometimes, but he actually listens, asks questions, learns on his own, and pays attention to the little things I say. It honestly means the world. I don’t really talk about it much, but I just felt like giving him a little appreciation post. He really is the best.

Any other type 1s out there with partners who just get it? Because wow, it makes such a difference.",excited,Happy
"I,17F,came out as bi and I’ve never felt more me I did it. I finally came out as bisexual—and honestly? I’ve never felt more confident or true to myself.

For the longest time, I kept it all in. I was scared of being judged, misunderstood, or even invalidated. But deep down, I knew. I’ve always known. And now that it’s out in the open, it feels like I can finally breathe.

Being a bi girl isn’t a phase. It’s not confusion. It’s real. And I’m so done shrinking myself to fit into other people’s ideas of what I should be.

To anyone out there questioning or holding it in: I see you. Take your time, move at your pace, but please know that there’s nothing wrong with who you are. You deserve to live openly and love fully—no matter who that love is for.

Just wanted to share this moment with people who might understand. I’m proud of me today.",excited,Happy

"My sister said i would be my nephews God mother I was talking to my older sister who has recently had her first baby. This is our first nephew & I love him to bits.
I was talking to my sister & the topic of who would look after him if something happened to them came up & she said ‘obviously its you’. I always assumed it would be my mum but she said she would want it to be me.
We both wanted to know what her husband thinks & when she asked the question he goes ‘(my name) obviously, who else’.
Its such a small small thing but it made me the absolute happiest.
I am not married nor have children & before she had her baby she always said she would not leave her baby alone with me😂because I would not look after him as I love my own space too much & for her to acknowledge everything I do for him makes me so happy.

"I JUST GOT INTO AN ACTUAL LOVING RELATIONSHIP Okay, so, all my life, I thought I was aro/ace because I've never fallen in love once. I've been in relationships before, but they were always just because the idea was so cool, not because I actually loved them. Anyways, a few months ago I met this guy named Maik! Maik me and Maik hit it off immediately, and we became friends super fast. We had the same sense of humor, we had the same struggles, we were comfortable around each other in ways we weren't with anyone else. Anyways, YESTERDAY I was really upset about being Aro/ace because I WANT a relationship, but I'll never be able to fall in love, blah blah blah. And he took that as his cue to confess that he had feelings for me, and ARGH that made me realize I had feelings for him too. Turns out, I'm not Aro/ace, I was just waiting for him. Also, just as a joke, I decided to see if our star signs were compatible, and I found out they are the #1 most compatible star signs? I don't believe in that star sign stuff, but it made me warm and fuzzy inside. Then I remembered that one trend that's like ""if your moon phases on your birthday complete eachother to form a full moon, you're soulmates!"" AND OURS COMPLETED EACHOTHER??? Again, I don't believe in this kind of stuff, but still! Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, and three times is fate. Just waiting on that third thing to fall into my lap. ANYWAYS, HERE'S SCREENSHOTS OF US DECIDING TO DATE EACHOTHER!! (also, side plot so you understand what we're talking about in some of the stuff, I was basically a lifeless marionette whose only function was to perform, but obviously it didn't have emotions, but that was just until I met him. Also the person whose name I blanked out is the name of my best friend, and also we agreed to call of the ""don't tell people"" thing because we both really wanted to brag about eachother",excited,Happy
"12/05/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy * Started looking at reducing my coffee intake from my diet which will help lower my blood pressure, I felt good with only one coffee, so I guess that's a good start!
* Caught up with another firehouse / fire station's crew for that one coffee and we had a good laugh at each other
* I was called big and intimidating which is kinda what I go for. So I was happy that I have been going in the right direction!
* We had Beef Brisket Burritos for dinner, they were so good! So simple to make too, throw it in the slow cooker, add some spice, done.",excited,Happy
"UPDATE: Quote book for my friend for his birthday gift. Original post: [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1kcxae7/i_wrote_a_book_for_my_friend_as_his_birthday_gift/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Guyssss!!!! Yesterday, May 11, was his birthday and HE LOVED THE BOOK!!! We were on a video call when he unboxed it. After seeing it, he couldn't stop smiling, and what I mean by smiling is, literally laughing. He couldn't take his eyes off the book. 🥹🥹🥹 I even screen recorded his reaction.

For the first few minutes, all he kept saying was ""Whattt"" and ""Woahh"" and extremely surprised. I think, he wasn't able to digest all of that, haha.

He was veryyyy happy, happy like a kid the whole time. He hates book (I knew it when I started creating a book for him), so I told him to read it in 1-2 months peacefully and give me a review at his pace, I didn't expect him to read it any sooner.

But he finished reading the book in less than 2 hours and even gave me a review.   
The book was perfect. He loved every single page. He thanked me for being so thoughtful. It was probably the grandest gesture anyone has ever done for him. He thanked me again and added that he was truly lucky to have me.

I replied that he deserved all that, he is worth doing grand gestures for. I also said ""Mutual feelings"" for truly lucky statement.   
  
He said, he didn't know why but he couldn't stop smiling, even after 2 hours 😂😂 and it was incredibly sweet of me.

I was veryyyy happy to see him like that. After our convos got over, I couldn't sleep for next hour cuz I was extremely happy that he liked the book thatttt much that he finished reading it the same night, in less than 2 hours. ✨✨✨

It went really well that I am feeling very peaceful and happy. 🍀🍀  
This early morning, he had to go outstation, so yesterday the whole day we didn't talk much. I knew he would be busy in packing and all, but I guess, we will talk about it peacefully once he comes back home. (We both are from different cultures and different states)",excited,Happy

"After 3 years of avoiding it, I've overcome my anxiety and got back to the gym! I'm just very proud of myself for getting back, it's been years since I stepped inside a gym.
I used to have panic attacks every time I would step inside, I was far too anxious to be around people, but I have been having health issues that I suspect are related to my sedentary lifestyle and I am determined to improve my health and improve my mind too.

It's only the beginning but I actually jogged for 20 mins without feeling like vomiting, did a few reps for back and arms and stretched!

That's all, I hope everyone is having a lovely day ❤️",excited,Happy

"I received a miracle before my birthday weekend Hello everyone,

Hope you are doing well. Just got some life changing news today. I will receive a free Burning Man ticket for 2025, normally priced around $600! Also received a free beard trim from my favorite barber, which was kind of him to do! 

I wasn't sure if I could go to Burning Man this year as I'm saving up for an apartment but this miracle happen, on my birthday weekend no less. This is the first time I am crying happily in a long time. I didn't think this would happen again as I don't get lucky very often but the universe has other plans. Thank you to the Burning Man Org. and the universe for this incredible early birthday gift. I am most grateful and will sleep very well tonight. 

Have a great day wherever life takes you and take care! 

❤️❤️

This bleak world maybe falling to pieces nowadays but I can't help feeling blessed and happy. Even when writing this post from bed, being slightly sick. However, maybe for the first time in my life, I can say that I'm actually, really happy. I have a lovely family, friends, love, health (not right now but overall), just enough to get by (even though no savings or wealth etc), I like where I'm living and the sun is shining today. I know this is not going to last, I have been suffering for years and years and most times I feel like I don't deserve to be happy. But I enjoy it while it's here. I just felt like expressing it somewhere and I'm glad I found this space to do so. Reading about other people's bliss is also a beacon of hope amidst the dark abyss that surrounds us, these days.

"I recently bought a new laptop and I am SOO happy about it!!! I **never** spend large amounts of money and strongly dislike spending in general.  
I am a gamer though and my current Alienware laptop was like over 10 years old and outdated. No new released games played well on it and I was aware I needed an upgrade.

My tech friend took me to Best Buy and helped me find a new Alienware gaming laptop. We found one that was ""open box"" but in excellent shape. Meaning it was originally $2k but because someone already opened it and returned it was now $1.5k even though it's in the same condition.

We spent hours updating and fine tuning it and I couldn't be happier! Considering I spend most of my time on the laptop and call it my ""electronic bf"" this is a win for me. It plays all of my fav high end games at the highest graphic settings smoothly. I never had that before because I always bought cheap laptops.",excited,Happy

Every day for us something new

Open mind for a different view

And nothing else matters""

      Is this what made her fall in love wirh me? No. Probably not, but it definitely enhanced her love.

6 May 2025

      After an 8 hour long trip we made it to the hotel. Things were a bit awkward with her, since she admitted she liked me at the same time i liked her. Also knowing she does like me rn. Either way i was determined to confess my love to her asap, knowing that she also was convinced i didn't like her. So when we headed to bed we started talking, and talking, flirting a bit more with each message until we realized that we were in love, and damn it felt good.
       Talking about our love for eachother was so amazing there are no ways to describe it, but if i were to describe it it would sounds something like this ""a rainy night, midnight even, sitting alone watching thunder pour down on earths gaze while you watch the city illuminating the sky with a warm, dim yellow light. Worries are a thing of the past, you only live the moment. Thinking about the future is your favourite activity. You think about your future with her. You feel as happy as you never were. You fill full once in your life again"". 
        Opening up about our feeling was the best thing ever and i don't regret a second of it. Will tomorrow be akward? Yes, totally. Will it be one of the most precious moments ever? Yes, again. My love for her is deeply rooted in my heart and i could never make it go away. Sending her a simple poem that was copy pasted from Metallica is cheap, but makes a hell of a difference. 
       Setting her finally being happy is nothing short of magical. Seeing her happy is the spring to my winter. She could easily repair my issues just by being there and that's what i love the most about her. 
       On a random rainy day of late-October i met her. A drawing course. I went there to learn some stuff here and there but i left with someone so precious i could never afford to lose.
       In a couple of days is our first date. I can't wait.",excited,Happy
"I love my family so much and I’m so grateful for them. I graduated college yesterday and I did not realize how much it would mean to me. My whole life I figured I would get a bachelors degree so I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal, but I’m so happy. I’m a first generation college student. And I’m so grateful for my family, my dad cried at my graduation, and my family just kept telling me how proud they were. My mom also told me she was so proud of me and excited for me because I’ve done something she was never able to, so she gets to keep watching my journey and live vicariously through me. My grandma also always tells me how excited she is and proud of me because I have so much going for me and I have so many opportunities. And then apparently after my parents when home my dad came up to my mom gave her a big hug and was like, “we did it, like we raised a good kid I’m so proud of her”. I didn’t realize how much this meant for my family and I’m just so grateful to have such a good support system and I’m proud that I did it. My parents didn’t have the opportunity I did. I wish I knew how to show them how much I appreciate them and how they’ve cheered me on. I’m hopefully on to PA school next, but they just never stop telling me how proud they are and I just love them so much. This post doesn’t have much of a point I’m just so grateful and full. I didn’t realize how much this would mean to me. ",excited,Happy

But today, in the middle of all that overstimulating energy, I turned a corner and found these shirts.

"I (23F) now believe in love for the first time in my life Myself (23f) and my partner (23M) have been seeing each other for nearly a year and a half now.

Before him I’d been in some pretty awful relationships. I was treated like a mother rather than a partner in one and abused in another. 

I’ve known my current partner for 3 and a half years now and we’d always danced around the idea of trying a relationship but for many different reasons it didn’t happen. I’d really liked him on several occasions and him me too, but I was so scared of commitment and being abandoned that I didn’t want to try things. But at the start of February 2024 I had the sudden realisation that I was pretty much in love with him and if I didn’t act fast I’d lose my chance with him. So I called him up and asked him on a date. Thankfully he said yes.

We’ve been seeing each other since then and I have never been in a happier relationship. I’m glad we happened at the time we did because by then we were both ready for it and were able to be the best people we can be together.

I’ve been pretty much star struck since we started dating that he’s actually *my* boyfriend but last week it’s like my love clicked again. I’m so unbelievably in love with him. I’m no longer scared of losing him or feel he could leave at any moment. I feel so secure and happy it’s wonderful. 

He is the first thought I have in the morning and the last one before bed. He makes me laugh at times I just want to never do anything ever again. He makes me feel beautiful and smart and I genuinely think he is the most sweet and incredible person in the entire world. I love making him feel that way too. We’re starting to look at houses to move in together in the coming months and I just can’t believe how lucky I am.

From someone who once felt unloveable, deserving of abuse and had completely lost hope in the existence of love. I promise you it gets better. Love is out there and it’s incredible.


TL;DR, If you love someone do something about it. They could be the love of your life.",excited,Happy
"I just got to witness something really beautiful now that I write it down it seems a little silly, but I was in a bad mood all day today and suddenly it started storming so  I went out to watch. So I have my headphones in listening to the Smith's and I kinda just look up, and dozens of purple strings shoot out in the sky lighting it up for a second before disappearing. It was so beautiful and I was a little awestruck, just wondering how many beautiful moments I've missed simply because I chose not to acknowledge them. I didn't witness world peace or do something I loved, I just so happened to look up at the right moment and watch a lightning storm and I'm very happy I did and just wanted to share lol",excited,Happy
"I was able to take my first HOT shower in FIVE months! We lost our home to hurricane milton. We got a new trailer but it needed alot of work. We had been staying with friends so I had access to a shower but since we moved in to the trailer all we've had was sponge baths then cold showers. Today we installed a used water heater. I took my first hot shower in five months and I think it restored my soul. 

Hot showers are one of my things. Those things that make life worth living. Worth going to work for. Worth putting up with stuff for. And to go that long without one was definitely a trial. 

In addition to that in our last home (rv) we couldn't even use the shower so while we had hot showers they were in the camp showers and shared with fifty other people. And only had one shower for women and one for men. 

So I haven't had a hot shower in my own home in probably six years. The idea that I can at any moment just get up and go take a hot shower is mind boggling to me. 

Some weeks during the winter we only showered once a week because we couldn't handle the freezing water. Or took sponge baths. 

It's the small things that make life worth living. ",excited,Happy

this month we moved out of our house we lived in for the past 3 years. it was emotional walking through as we were about to leave for the last time. i was tearing up while listing all the amazing memories we made there. he took my ring off my finger, got down on one knee, and proposed again. the water works were deeply activated at this point, but it was one last final great memory in our home. from the most wonderful man.",excited,Happy

"Things get better - romantic relationships I (26F) have had a few relationships, only two lasting over a year, with the longest being 3 years. All have been with men that were just plain wrong and bad for me, at best negligent, at worst manipulative. I made my mistakes, had poor judgement, stayed when I should have left, and had PLENTY of short term complicated casual affairs (situationships). I had this love inside of me that I just wanted to share and feel that kind of pure love in return. I felt hopeless and finally read ‘the unexpected joy of being single’ (MUST READ) which caused a short but complete break in dating of any kind and decided I was ready to break this cycle and try again, try to find the real deal.

The first man (28M) I met after this break was completely unlike anyone I had ever dated, or ever imagined dating, and we have had the most beautiful and real 8 months together. It’s early days, but this relationship, even in difficult times, has been the healthiest and most genuine relationship I could have ever imagined. I’m in therapy which helps, but we communicate, take space, celebrate, laugh and have so much fun together. He is gentle and patient with my traumatic past and I’m in awe of it all.

He is asleep in my lap while I watch a movie and I’m in heaven.

I hope this post is well received, I just want to share that better is possible and waiting for you, even if you feel hopeless. Even if we don’t last forever, this love has changed my life and given me faith in love again.

TL;DR finding real love is possible even if you’ve never felt it before.",excited,Happy
"I wrote a book for my friend as his birthday gift and I didn't let him get any clues. As title says, I've made a quote book for my friend.

Once in October 2024, he mentioned that if he becomes great someday, he'll publish his quote book. But I think that he's already pretty great, so why to wait 5-7 years for a book?

I starred that message back then in our chat, and now after all these months, I've made a hardcover casewrap book for him.

His bday is within next 10 days, but he might leave early so I'm gonna wrap it nicely and give him before he leaves but I'll tell him to open only on his bday . 

I'm veryyyyy excited for his reaction when he'll first unbox his gift and will find his book. 🥹🥹🥹",excited,Happy
"I just watched a cat jump on a couch in the background of a confessional in a reality tv show and knew my pregnant wife had fallen asleep because she didn’t mention it. It made me smile from ear to ear and she doesn’t get to see these moments but I searched for a sub just like this to tell as many people as I could. I rub her feet nightly on her way to sleep while we watch whatever and there’s always a joke I make that she doesn’t laugh at that I know she would have that lets me know it’s time to pause and begin to shift for circulation to return to my legs. But today was a great day, we went to listen to our heartbeat for the second time and we were just enjoying the night quietly tonight but that cat jumped up and she didn’t point it out and knowing she was out and that such an adorable thing was still a tell for me in our routine and thinking about all the examples I wanted to set for our son and everything compounded to just a purely awesome moment for me.

"My husband remembers The Brownie Rule™️, even when I don’t My husband and I made up The Brownie Rule™️ early on in our marriage (over 10 years ago). It’s been over 5 years since it’s been used. The rule is, when there is an odd number of brownies, I get the extra. 

We got an order of Domino’s brownies with our dinner this week, and he did the divvying up of the brownies. He gave me my half and said, “There, we’ve followed the brownie rule!”

I had totally forgotten, so he reminded me. He is always honest with me, and thinks the world of me. He makes me smile every day, is a great communicator, a fantastic parent, and so driven to take care of our family. 

He has been by my side as my best friend since 2010, we’ve been together since 2011, and got married in 2013. I was 19, and we were so sure of each other, and everyone saw that he treated me so well, that there weren’t any actual objections to us getting married so young. When I wound up with schizoaffective disorder, I was just a shell of a person and was not the most pleasant person to be around. He was there by my side, encouraging me to keep going, taking care of our son and home, keeping up with my medical stuff, and doing whatever he could to keep us afloat when I was unable to work for a few years.  

We have our home, our son, and our wonderful family of blood relations and soul relations. We have a fun dog, a running vehicle, and a whole lot of love. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I just want to tell how much I love him to the world. ",excited,Happy

Tonight I was a bit emotionally happy idk I was just feeling really happy with him and how well our relationship has progressed in almost 10 months!

"Reunited with my lost dog 8 years later, the day before my birthday! When I was pregnant with my first child in 2017 my mom gave away my dog and wouldn't tell me who so I thought I would never see him again.

The day before my birthday I took my kids to the park and noticed a dog that looked similar to my current dog an Australian Shepherd.

My daughter said the other was a shiba inu so I looked closer and noticed it was a large yorkie without a doxxed tail.

I thought of my old dog but it didn't click at first! Once I realized there probably aren't a lot of giant yorkies running around I took a closer look.

It was him! I gave him some snuggles and added his owner on instagram and took a picture (he was giving me a kiss). He is well groomed and well trained. I am so happy I got to see him again and he is happy/healthy.

He is 10 years old now!",excited,Happy
"After 22 years, I finally learned how to ride a bike! This may seem like a small achievement to some, but to me, it means the world. 

I grew up pretty poor and never learned how to ride a bike, but I’ve always wanted to. My dad was very good at it when he was younger, but unfortunately he had his bikes stolen before I was born. I always admired him for his skill, and wished I could be like him someday. 

Well, I’m 22 now and one of my relatives who no longer rides decided I could have their bike. It needed cleaned and a new chain,  and I did that. I’m overweight and my balance isn’t great, so for the first two times I tried learning with the help of my roommate I got very frustrated and just could not get it.

But today, I tried yet again, and of course i couldn’t get it no matter how hard I tried and I was getting so incredibly frustrated, I thought it must’ve been because I wasn’t talented and just could not get it.

But suddenly, right when I was about to quiet, a few young men in a nice grey sports car rolled up to the parking lot and rolled down the windows and shouted “YOU’RE DOING GREAT! YOU’VE GOT THIS!” And then drove off. And honestly, this helped so much, I think it was the last push I need - I immediately put my all into my next attempts and I DID IT! I fucking DID IT, guys! I’ve been wanting to do it for so long and I finally managed to ride it! A few more tries with my roommate pushing me, then I managed to do it myself several times!

The neighbors of my apartment complex who were outside at that point even cheered me on and gave me tips, and it was so awesome to be able to do something I’ve always wanted to do.

I know this really is a small achievement, but I already feel myself wanting to get back on and do it again tomorrow. I have a feeling this will help me get out of my depressive episode and finally help me get some exercise. It’s a huge achievement for me and I’m so proud of myself for it.

To whoever those young men were in the grey car, thank you so much - you gave me the final push I really needed to finally be able to move forward.

Every time I ride now I think of my dad - thank you for everything and I just wish you were here to see me now. ",excited,Happy
"A stranger helped me and it felt really nice Yesterday, I went to the supermarket with my kid. Before that, we had gone to see his dad (his office is nearby) and I left everything with him (backpack with keys, his change of clothes, etc) before going to buy the stuff we needed. 

I got to the register and a lady behind me was looking kinda nervous with a sole bag of rice. I thought she was maybe going to ask me to go ahead of me, I had probably 10 or 15 things, not much, but still, I was going to let her go first, I was in no hurry. Then she asks ""Could you please save my spot? I just need eggs"" I assured her that would be no problem. My kid, being the goofy kind soul he is, started to march around her bag of rice that she left so that on one would take it either. She came back not a minute later, grateful and talking to my kid for a bit. 

Once my things had been checked, I realized I had left my wallet in the backpack! I kinda panicked. I could use a QR code to pay, but I had not enough money in that account and my second account didnt' work with the QR code. I called my husband to ask him to pay, that I would send him the QR code, but the lady at the register was already giving me the stinkiest eye ever. 

After 3 minutes of waiting (I checked) and husband not being able to pay and also getting worried on the other end of the line, I told the exasperated woman behind the register to just cancel the whole transaction and I would be back within 10 minutes. It is then that the lady behind me said ""Hey, I can pay it for you and then you can transfer the money. That okay?"" I was like ""Yes! Thank you so much! Give me your number, I'll do it right now. Thank you again!"" She was all smiles and told me it was no problem. She paid my bill, paid hers and then I transferred the money to her account. 

It was such a nice moment for me. It left me smiling for the rest of the night. ",excited,Happy

"How my now Fiancé healed me of my baggage with a kiss. I just wanted to come on here and document one of my most healing moments l've ever experienced-even if it happened over a year ago now, I still remember it like it was yesterday!

For context, I used to have trauma relating to physical touch from my first relationship (among other things, but that's not relevant for this story), where one of the results was in a fear of kissing.

With that being said, here's my story:

After taking years to heal from my prior abusive relationship, I (22F) finally felt ready to enter back into the dating scene. After searching (for surprisingly not a long time), I matched with my Fiance (27M), and we started going out.

I was very much a slow burn, and I warned him as much. Once we were a few dates in, he asked if he could kiss me for the first time. Of course, with me being a slow burn and having a reluctance towards kissing, I politely turned him down. But I also made sure to reassure him that I was definitely interested in him, just that I needed more time.

Now, after a few more dates, I was really starting to fall for this guy. After a particularly lovely night where he took me to a concert and the night was filled with laughter and conversation, he asked once more if he could kiss me, right as I was leaving his car.

I looked at him, and just felt so in awe of him. I thought, ""Man, I'm really starting to like this guy. I think he's earned it- he deserves at least one wholesome peck."" More importantly, I wanted to give him a kiss.

In the abusive relationship that I was in, I always felt forced, manipulated, or bargained into giving physical affection- particularly with kisses. The first kiss I ever shared with my ex gave me the worst gut feeling I have ever felt in my life. I truly believe that feeling was from my guardian angel, and that I was being warned about the relationship I was entering.

Anyways, back to this newfound healthy love!

We leaned in and shared the most wonderful kiss. I cannot stress this enough- it felt unreal. It couldn't have lasted for more than half a second, and yet time genuinely seemed to stop for me. I experienced the most intense feel-good butterflies l've ever felt. It seemed just like the movies and stories l've read; sparks seemed to fly around us in that moment.

It was such a beautiful, healing moment for me. To go from such horrible, gut-wrenching fear and trauma, to feeling over the moon in happiness is something I'll never forget.",excited,Happy
"I finally have pants after only being able to wear pajama bottoms for almost a year I gained a lot of weight after graduating high school and stopped fitting into most of my pants. After almost a year of having almost no actual pants left to wear and just dealing with awkward-fitting pajamas, I went thrifting, picked up 5 pairs of pants, and they all fit amazingly. I have pants! I like dressing nicely, so I’ve felt so insecure not having any clothes to wear apart from one ill-fitting pair of slacks and two pairs of sweatpants that are way too hot for my climate that I just gave up on the way I dressed and have largely stopped going outside or visiting people because I don’t have enough clothes to pack for more than a day or two at a time. This is huge for me. I no longer have to cycle between sweatpants that make me heatsick and a frumpy, too-short pair of slacks. I. Have. Pants! And now if I decide to lose weight, it’ll be out of choice, and not out of absolute necessity of needing to be able to fit into clothes that won’t make me heatsick when I go outside.",excited,Happy
"We just adore this and it put a smile on our face 😊 - Young Irish farmer's genius hack to keep calves entertained day and night The best way to keep happy calves is by providing them with hoppy entertainment, a young farmer says. Irish man and farmer Philip Stewart, 28, has come up with some creative ideas to keep his farm animals in high spirits.

His calves love to play with massive red space hoppers- which are usually used by children to bounce up and down on. The third generation farmer says toys that keep his animals occupied are paramount to their happiness.

He also fills small holed balls with hay so that the young cows have fun while feeding. The farmer, who has a Youtube channel documenting the antics of his family’s 400-acre farm, said: “Happy calves need enrichment, and the Temu space hopper - usually a children’s toy - is keeping the bulls entertained in the barn day and night.”

After completing his farming qualifications in 2016, Philip runs a farm with around 250 dairy beef calves. He wanted to put his own stamp on the family business - and one of his ideas was looking at different ways to acquire bulk products needed for its everyday running.

The farmer buys many supplies from online shopping platform Temu - including the space hoppers and hay balls. He also purchased products from the site that he found hard to access in the Irish midlands, such as a vaccine gun, 20 syringes and several bottles.

Philip said: “We use a large bag of syringes and bottles every week for multi-mineral shots and vaccines. But the local co-op usually sells vaccine consumables in batches of five or ten.

""We just need consumable quantities that work for our commercial scale – Temu had them and we got them fast. And when our dosing gun broke, we had spares ready to go. It was a lifesaver.

“Our friends and fellow farmers were sceptical at first, and now our friends are asking where we got everything.”",excited,Happy
"A stranger paid for our meal like a generous ninja My family was on vacation this weekend in Palm Springs and we went out to dinner. The gentleman at the adjacent table noticed my husband's sportswear and said he used to live in our state, and we talked football for a while, then he and his son left and we said goodbye.

When we asked for the check for our meal 10 minutes later, we were told, ""It's been taken care of, tip and all."" 

To that sweet man, thank you for that! It seems unfair to exchange pleasant conversation for a free meal, but we will pay it forward.

"Wanted to share how a simple incident answered the most difficult question I've had my entire life. Just realized what I want in life

Hi everyone. I am 23 M, been single all my life due to poor life choices and an unhealthy family setting but that's in the past. I've always run for stuff like it would complete me but never really knew what I actually wanted in life. 

Tried therapy and everything and the biggest question ever lingered - What did I truly want from life? 

The answer was seemed complex to me, maybe money, maybe fame, maybe attention and I ran in search of it - read books, watched videos on how to be a rizzler and some weird and embarrassing stuff then I met someone. We're not a thing atm but it made me realize what I wanted in life. 

The biggest question of my life was finally answered and it was something so simple I dismissed it casually but it was Love. 

Never got the love from my family that I needed nor from anyone else but this girl made me realize is that I do not crave superficial stuff but love and affection and someone to call my own. The post may seem cringe to many but I'm smiling while laying in bed with this thought in bed and happy that I finally found what I lacked in life. 

TLDR; Guy troubled entire life, doesn't know what he wants realized he needs love.",excited,Happy

But when my grandmother had her name called everyone in the stadium clapped and cheered for her.

Reddit has helped my depression so many times just by existing. My loneliness can get the best of me but that feeling when I post and then start to have dialogue with another Redditor makes me feel so alive and human in a way that makes my heart leap. I feel seen and connected. I’m so thankful for this massive community of humans connecting with humans in ways that matter to one another about topics we enjoy. There’s really nothing like Reddit. And I’m thankful to the kind souls who reply to comments and say one things or write great advice or encourage you when you’re down. There are a lot of beautiful humans in the world and Reddit lets me find some of them—often at times I’ve needed it the most. ,excited,Happy
"25/04/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy - there was such a large turnout to the dawn service this morning to respect our fallen heroes on ANZAC Day. I'm a very proud Australian and I'm so happy that our local community, young and old, came to show their respects. Lest We Forget.
- I had a breakfast with my old firefighting crew after the dawn service. It was ice catching up with them and seeing what they're up to.
- My gorgeous wife and I went out to grab a cheeky acai on a cheeky acai date. It was nice spending time with her on a nice sunny day. A couple sat next to us and we had a little chat about their speciality made ANZAC biscuit/ custard creations. ",excited,Happy

"I'm so happy I finally made the call to resign my job The leaders were absent, living in their own bubble, and I've had too much work to do for too long. This was due to many new employees that were replacing the good colleagues I once had. The good work environment we once had was gone. 

After I resigned I'm so, so relieved. I feel physically better, my tension in neck and shoulders are almost gone, and I'm mentally much more at ease.

My new job pays less, but enough. Health and family time is more important. Many of my old colleagues that I loved working with is in the same, new company where I'm starting. ",excited,Happy
"It doesn’t cost anything to just be friendly. I had a really long day and almost went home with a really bad stomach ache and couldn’t focus on work stuff. I had to get a stamp to mail a prescription to Chewy for my dog, but I really didn’t wanna go & wanted to rot on the couch. But the employee at USPS was like oh I love Chewy after he saw where I was mailing it too and he showed me a picture of his cute kitty lol & then we started talking about pets and it just put me in a better mood. I got in my car and just smiled the way home after being in such a depressed mood. It’s the little things. ",excited,Happy
"Hollow to happy - I once wished for overwhelming days like this Wanted to take a moment to appreciate my happy annoyance and overstimulation.

I had a really *really* long and tiring day today, filled with cooking for fun for me and my lil cousin (stuff that many people in the family stole bites from and appreciated!), getting exasperated with doing technical stuff like filling in attendance and marksheets for SO MANY students for my mother, finishing my remote work and talking to clients, going to an exercise class, being irritated but spending time selecting pictures with care and sending my friend fashion inspo tips and reels, so on, so on.

And I sat down, sighing like a character does in movies, who finally gets rest after a whole day of chaos. I saw the time at 3 pm, realised only less than half the day had passed, and it is just the afternoon. I had an epiphany - you do get what you prayed for.

From days that went by too fast and were too short because I'd either wake up late due to depression and anxiety and sleep through my troubles, or days where I'd simply finish them by watching the same five shows under my blanket with no outside interaction. Days when men I dated or friends who were too busy caused me anxiety or heartbreak, or disgust. Days back, when I attached self-worth to the little downvotes on random Reddit comments. None of this matters tbh now.

Now, (again), I finally have people to fuss over, work to do, so many plans that I have the privilege to cancel, unread messages to return in an overflowing inbox of relationships I've cultivated with love and happy migraines to get. This is what heaven feels like and damn it took years to get. I have no plans of letting it go. Ever.",excited,Happy

* We all went out to lunch at the holiday park my daughter is going to (in a few days)  with her friends. This is her first holiday with friends and it is a big step and I am really happy she organised it.
* I wanted a milkshake. I got a milkshake. It was everything I wanted it to be. Chocolate, milky, frothy goodness. Man, I love a good milkshake.",excited,Happy

"One of the moments when I knew I found ""the one"" About a year ago, me and my girlfriend visited her parents during easter. Everything was going well until the last day, I accidently clogged the toilet.

I tried to fix it but couldn't. Sitting there not knowing what to do, I realised that the battle was lost, so I discreetly called for my girlfriend.

She came in to the bathroom, I looked her dead in the eyes and said:

""What wasn't supposed to happen, happened"" while pointing my finger at the toilet.

She looked at it, started to laugh and said:

""Finally it wasn't me who did it"".",excited,Happy

* Played Mahjong for the first time and really enjoyed it, I like how it is a number of different games depending on the initial tile. Had a great time, learning curve wasn't as long as I thought and we just went with it.
* My mate who we haven't seen in about a year came over with treats! He used to stay with us when he was training with the police and  he would always give my son a pack of tim tams as payment for taking his room when he came over. So he said that he is now 2 weeks in advance and gave my sone two packs of tim tams and a bunch of other treats for the family. We caught up and loosely planned to catch up again tomorrow.",excited,Happy

"I saw a rare bass once and fell in love, so my partner tracked one down and drove half a day to get it for me! We're in the UK where driving half a day on your day off is considered a LOT of driving! 

I'm an ex-gigging guitarist who got super burned out and hasn't done anything musical in a while. I recently got into bass and it's rekindled a passion so I've been playing a cheapo bass a lot! Last year I'd seen a band use a Daisy Rock bass and I fell in love with how unique it was. They're no longer manufactured and the bass counterparts were always rarer than the guitars, but my partner managed to find one and go get it for me! It was meant to be a birthday present but he couldn't resist giving me it early. Feeling very special and loved, and having lots of fun! ",excited,Happy

"I think I am finally happy, I just experienced such a sudden but impactful change in my life I wouldn't say I felt unhappy, but for a long time I felt a lack of motivation and a lack of meaning in life, like I was an incomplete person who did well enough but knew there was room for improvement. I decided recently to do something about it and just wanted to see if there was anyone who had similar feelings about life who could be with me on my journey, like a close accountability partner, I tend to do better when I have someone like that I can confide in. I made a simple post just talking about the kind of person I am like my faults, and what I desire in someone. I was expecting harsh criticism, sly remarks, and I did certainly get it from people, since the idea of anyone wanting a feeling of love in their life seems to tick people off and make them say the worst online, but to my absolute surprise someone came to me and offered. I mean it has not been that long at all but just the gesture made me feel special, and she has already been so much more comfortable for me to talk to than a lot of other people, I genuinely feel like I can relax around her and we can just enjoy talking and getting to know eachother, it is a truly amazing feeling. I want to be a better person just because she is in my life now, and just the thought of her throughout my day makes me make better choices, I just am really satisfied with life right now. Just meeting the right person flipped a switch in me to want to change. I am truly grateful to her and while I feel like I don't know the right things to say (most of the time) or I am awkward, I feel like she doesn't have a problem with that and understands. I fear I scare people away because of how attached I can feel, but I feel like it is mutual this time around. I don't know a lot about her yet but I think that feeling of walking into the unknown is exciting, putting my trust into someone and not doubting at all, and I want to get to know more about her day by day like uncovering a mystery. I think this may be the most i've ever been effected by a person in such a short amount of time, it's exhilarating for me. Words fail to express the happiness I feel right now, how content I am with the way things are. Anyways.. Just needed that off my chest, I obviously cannot send a 40 page document to her describing every facit of emotion I am feeling, but I figured others may benefit from this and it may be a motivation to them to brighten their day \^-\^",excited,Happy
"20/04/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy - it's Easter, chocolate eggs for breakfast! 
- My daughter and I went to a nice drive, we went and got acai. The guys know her order and asked her if when she gets her licence will she still come back! Of course. They play loud dance music and we always have a good time there. 
- My beautiful wife and I were watching Chicago Fire as we started watching it as a joke and then we got hooked and invested. Anyway, two episodes in a row where someone dies and then the next someone gets trapped. I had a good friend and fellow firefighter die by a building collapse and it hit really hard. Watching this brought up memories, my wife, without hesitation asks is we should stop the show, skip it, just looking out for me. I love her so much. Little acts like that make me so happy and lucky.

As an even bigger Nintendo nerd, I can say that I teared up when I stepped foot into Nintendo Land and heard Gusty Garden Galaxy playing. I face-timed my friends in nearly a panic to show them how far my jaw was on the ground. 
I can’t describe how grateful I am. Today was such a special day, and the best part is I have another amazing opportunity to go again tomorrow, I missed out on a few rides today and I’m gonna try and knock them off my list tomorrow.

"I experienced a random act of kindness today at McDonald’s ☺️😎  
So, cool thing happened after I got off of work today. I went through the drive thru of McDonald’s to get something to eat and I noticed that the car in front of me didn’t stop to order something at the intercom, he just skipped it and went to the paying window. I thought it was odd but decided to just forget about it. I ordered my food through the intercom and when I got to the paying window it turns out the person in the car in front of me paid for my food. I really didn’t expect that to happen, I told the employee that I would still like to pay for my food because it just felt wrong not to. The employee talked to the manager to see what they would do and said that If I wanted to I could pay for the person behind me in line. I agreed to it. As I got to the window to receive my food I noticed in my side mirror the people behind me thanking me, I waved back at them. It was a nice experience but I only wish that I got to say thank you to the individual who paid for my order. ☺️",excited,Happy

"Sharing some positive mental changes I’ve been making against my ocd. 
A lot of positive stuff has happened lately. I’m settling into my new job that has a more fixed schedule, I’m learning to avoid the compulsions of changing my name, gender and pronouns all the time and just focusing on what feels authentic to me. I’m settling on the best options possible for me, not the perfect one. I’m settling on a fursona for the first time in 8 years and not compulsively making another one because the one I made isn’t “perfect”. I’m settling with this account and not compulsively making another one because it isn’t “perfect”. Im learning to accept that I’m mostly attracted to men and not forcing myself to like women. I’m learning to avoid the urge to compulsively purge my discord servers and join them again one week after I leave. I’m following a healthy diet and getting in exercise. I’m finding hobbies that bring fulfillment and slowly getting over asking for assurance from AI and the internet. Most importantly I feel motivated to better myself. And I’m going up in my Luvox dose. ",excited,Happy

* We saw sheep with massive bollocks! MASSIVE!! The whole crowd was commenting on them and it made me giggle.

Then I called our old teacher to get another classmate, John's, number, so I could tell the classmate I'd found Patti. I hadn't spoken to my teacher in seven or eight years, so that was really cool, too. And I left John a voicemail and will, knowing him, get a call within the next few hours. :)

"I can finally say I'm truly living and not just surviving I don’t think I’ve ever said this out loud before, but I can finally say it and mean it: I’m happy. Not just momentarily, not just pretending — I’m truly content with where I’m at in life. I’ve wished for this for so long, and now that I’m here, it feels surreal.

It hasn’t been an easy journey. I’ve battled depression, mental health struggles, and navigated the storm of a toxic relationship with my mother. I’ve moved multiple times just to find peace, stability, and a sense of home. There were days I questioned if things would ever get better, if all this effort would be worth it. But I kept going. I chose healing. I chose myself.

Now, I’m in a stable living situation with a steady job, and I’m studying nursing — something I’m passionate about because I want to help others the way I once needed help myself. It’s a demanding path, but I’m sticking with it, and I’m proud of my progress.

I’ve also started focusing on my physical health — working out, eating better, taking it slow but steady. I finally have a gym I like and a workout plan that feels good. For once, I feel like I’m moving in the right direction in all areas of life.

Family-wise, I’ve set boundaries, and that’s given me peace. Personally, I’m connecting with someone who makes me feel safe, respected, and appreciated — things I used to only hope for. It’s still early, but I like the direction it’s going.

Most importantly, I’m proud of who I am. I’ve worked so hard to heal and grow. I’ve turned pain into purpose. For the first time in a long time, I don’t feel like I’m just surviving — I’m living. And it feels amazing.

If you’re still in the middle of your storm, please don’t give up. You might not see it yet, but your peace is coming. It is possible. I’m living proof.

Thank you for reading — I just wanted to share my joy with someone.",excited,Happy
"22F in California : I am a happy person..anyone else? Hey! 

I just felt like sharing that because saying it to anyone I know would probably make them feel weird/bad. I am a happy person. I am happy with my life, the person I am, the person I've become. I have had an amazing childhood, I have great parents, a great sister, I've always been top students thanks to hard work. I am now living in the USA (San Francisco) for an internship. I'm so thankful for all that and I'm just happy all the time, even when I feel down (which can feel weird).
The thing is, I have NEVER met anyone like me when it comes to this.
I'll be saying all day long ""this makes me so happy/that is so nice, it makes me really happy/I love seeing the sun/I love these flowers/I'm so thankful to be here"" etc. and I feel like I'm the only one being that expressive about being happy and thankful. Anyone else like that?

It kinda saddens me that my level of expressiveness and happiness is unmatched with the persons I hang with

I have dreams : having a beautiful family, living in a nice house in the suburbs in the USA and dedicate myself to them 
This perspective also makes me super happy, although I don't know how I will get there yet (gotta meet the right persons) 

Anyway: I am happy and I like expressing it. I'd love to know I'd other persons like me exist out here haha

"Listening/watching songs with my autistic, 2 year old son... My son very rarely sits still.  All day he will run around, knock things down, throw temper tantrums, etc.  

But at night, when I'm able, and we listen to music, he'll cuddle up with me and listen/watch music/videos.  Vermillion PT. 2  by Slipknot is one of his favorites. Other songs/music videos include ""More Than Words"" by Extreme, ""Creep"" by Radiohead, ""Hate Me"" by Blue October, ""I Can Feel A Hot One"" by Manchester Orchestra, and ""Topsy's Revenge"" by Grand Archives. 

There are plenty more acoustic/sad songs, but these songs he loves the most.  

I often feel like I've failed as a father and husband.  I work hard but I am underpaid; we live paycheck to paycheck.  I suffer from major depression and bipolar disorder.  

But I swear, when my son cuddles up next to me and just lays with me while any one of the above songs plays.... Everything melts away.  I cry because I am happy and not sad.  

My little dude and me almost fall asleep listening/watching this songs.  I just love it.  It just makes me happy, which is few and far between.  ",excited,Happy

"Seeing the difference today in pictures makes me Happy Pardon the mess—I'm in the middle of moving—but I just had to share this win.

The “before” photo is from around 2012 when I was at my heaviest—over 349 lbs (my scale errored out above that). Today, I weigh in at 175 lbs at 43 years old. It’s been a long road full of hard work, setbacks, and restarts, but I’m still standing—just on much lighter feet.

There’s a lot of loose skin that’s not pictured, but what is shown is someone who feels a whole lot better physically and mentally. I still have work to do, but today, I’m taking a moment to feel proud.

Thanks for letting me share this with all of you. Stay kind to yourselves and keep going—you never know how far you can come until you look back.

"Little girl called me “daddy” and I couldn’t be happier I’m just very happy and wanted to talk about it to internet strangers (: I’m about to to tell a very summarized version of my life so sorry lol

I met my now fiancée, Sammy(29F) when we were in high school. We were very close friends and hung out all time until she moved away to another state. It was very sudden and it sucked for a while. I graduated college and moved on with my life until I met her again at the age of 26. We both caught up and I found out about her daughter, K, who at the time was only about 3 months old (won’t be sharing her real name). her bio father wasn’t involved. We stayed in touch and over time started dating. I eventually met her daughter who was a very happy 10 month old. I proposed to Sammy near the end of last year, and we had already moved in together at that point. I happily stepped up for the role of father for K, and she is now a chaotic and loud 3 year old.

Last night, K thought it would be a great idea to throw all of the clothes in her dresser on the floor. She giggled as she proudly presented her work to us. Her mother wasn’t as happy, and was already tired and stressed. I wanted to avoid a pissed fiancée, so I helped k put all her clothes back, which consisted of me doing most of the work. After we finished our cleanup, she looked me dead in the eye and said “thank you daddy!” Then ran off to the living room.

I was slightly stunned. I’ve always known I was her father figure, and I don’t know why it took me this long to realize that I actually had a baby girl now. This was the first time she ever called me daddy. I haven’t told anyone about it yet, And wanted to express my excitement right now. I love my soon-to-be wife and daughter so much. I just can’t wait to be a dad and raise this little girl.",excited,Happy
"Reddit's baby 🥰 months ago I promised pictures, I'm finally delivering I don't know if any of the people from the original post will find this but a while back I posted a picture of my cow themed gender reveal for my baby girl. I mentioned that my husband and I had met through Reddit and a bunch of the people in the comments adopted my little girl and dubbed themselves aunts, cousins, etc. Hopefully this reaches some of the same people. I promised pictures and here she is! Little miss Tracy Belle. She is 3 months old 🥰",excited,Happy
"Musician neighbor (who I'm secretly a fan of) finally hit the high note! I live in an apartment at one point had a neighbor who put their keyboard in their bedroom closet (which shares a wall with my closet). I loved listening to them play at night but after a few years it seemed they had moved the keyboard, invested in headphones, or moved away. I really missed how it added a sort of parasocial, strangely moving atmosphere to warm summer nights with the window open where I could hear them from my bed. For an hour or so a few times a week I just got to love and admire a stranger just as a person I share the world with.

A few weeks ago, I heard a guitar. My keyboard neighbor is now, or was replaced by, a guitar guy. He sounded okay? Not confident or particularly seasoned but I could tell he was trying to hit the high note in Take On Me by A-ha. Bold choice.

The next couple weeks, same song and he's running through that chorus over and over again. I don't have it in me to be annoyed, I'm invested. This man is my favorite sport, I am his number one fan and I'm holding my breath every time he gears up to try for that note AND HE HITS IT! The crowd (me) goes wild (jumps up and punches the air)! We're both surprised and HE DOES IT AGAIN. *HE'S GOT IT FOLKS!*

I'll never tell him I'm listening, I don't want to ruin the magic happening here or add any additional pressure to perform. However, I'm excited for him. I'm happy to be his neighbor. I'm honored I get to attend his semi-regular concerts. ",excited,Happy
"Went to an air show for the first time ever. MIND BLOWN. What a beautiful display of human achievement. The bravery, the courage, the precision, the dedication. Filled my little heart with so much joy to witness this utterly jaw dropping feat. To all the women and men involved, mad respect. To all the lovely people out there, I hope you all appreciate each other and this beautiful country we are in ❤️",excited,Happy
"13/04/25 - Posting daily updates on what makes me happy * I got a night in bed. No calls over night so a full nights sleep was great.
* Woke up to a call from a firefighter from an oncoming shift that they are not able to come in, so I got an extra 2 hours of overtime pay. Easy overtime too. the oncoming shift didn't want me to do anything so I just relaxed.
* When I got home my wife just finished in the shower and needed a towel, so the first thing I see if my gorgeous wife in her birthday suit! What a great way to be welcomed home!
* Went out with my wife shopping for my son's birthday that's coming up. Then we got some churros and hot chocolate. I love my wife so much! I love spending time with her.
* Got a few compliments today, it was really nice getting those. Makes me happy and feels like I'm doing something right! ",excited,Happy
"First time I go shopping and feel happy? I've been overweight my entire life.
Every single time I go to buy clothes has been the worst day of my life. I can't find my size even in plus size stores, everything fits weird, everything looks like it's made for the elderly.
So I usually avoid shopping at all costs. 
I finally lost the weight over the course of the last year and decided to venture out to the store for the first time since, today. 
Every item I picked up and tried fit... 
I still cannot believe it. Every single item!!!! 
I know it's silly but it made me sooo happy within that I didn't leave the stores feeling terrible about myself and my body and was genuinely in a good mood.
I don't have anyone to share these kinds of thoughts with so here I am. ",excited,Happy
"today was probably the best day of my life so, i just started a new school, after being homeschooled for 7 years. i'm a sophomore. when i first started i was literally so scared. welllll, today we had spring fling day, and the theme was anything but a backpack, and i won that. then, during water games we had a water balloon fight, and the softball coach came up to me and acted like i had the arm of a god and told me that next year i don't even really have to try out, i already have a spot. THEN, i went and played volleyball with some girls and the volleyball coach came up to me and told me i need to try out this May. THEN, during the relays i was told i was the fastest person there and the track coach said she was literally in awe of me. i've always been athletic, but bc ive never really been around other people i didn't know just how athletic i was. okay here comes the good part.

i have a 4.2 GPA and i just took my history final yesterday, and i was the only person in the class to get a perfect score. because of that i got tested for honors classes, and i passed!!! i don't start them until next year, but still im so happy about it. ik that most of you are thinking like ""what how is this the best day of your life?"", but you have to remember i was literally never around people, never had any chance to do this kind of stuff. i struggled with depression the entire time i was homeschooled, was on meds and everything. ever since ive been in school (1 and 1/2 months) i haven't had a single suicidal thought. another thing thats probably stupid, but i have like so many guys after me. like so many it's insane. idk all of this stuff just makes me feel really good. i'm going for student counsel next week. i really hope i get it. anyways yeah i just kinda wanted to talk all about my day and i didn't want to do it with anybody i know bc i don't want to seem too egotistical, so that's why im doing it anonymously 😅. i hate hate hate bragging about myself, this is like the only time i ever have. i just feel really happy about all of this.

"Reconnected with old friends and pushed myself to talk to a hiring manager in hopes of working with them. I’m so happy right now. I’ve been eating healthy for a couple months now, it really shows. 

I’ve been struggling with finding work but I went across the street to a ford dealership and asked if they’re hiring. Manager told me to apply online and I did. I really need a job so I pushed myself with the help from someone close to me and I went in person for an update. Manager pulled up my application, asked me a few questions and he’s going to forward my application to the higher up. Even if I may or may not get hired, I was pretty happy I pushed myself because I have AWFUL social anxiety.

I reconnected with a friend from high school, I’ve been having a lot dreams about my high school friends and I miss them a lot so I pushed myself to talk to one of them and now we added each other on discord.

I finally got check by a doctor last week too and I’m going the following week to get some lab work done. I want to find out the reason why I have brain fog. Also to check if theirs anything wrong with me.

I haven’t felt this happy in a very long time and I pray everything works out. ",excited,Happy

"My Wife Is The Single Best Thing to Ever Happen To me. I'm (24m) really just here to brag about my wife (25m) but also to remind people love still exists and that it's not all doom and gloom out there. Especially for those of us in Gen Z. Hell we met on tinder so anything's possible. 

I woke up at 6AM and was about to be late for work and ended up rushing out of the house without our normal morning goodbye and just didn't realize it. As I got into work I got these texts and it lit my day back up. She's awesome and I don't know what I'd do without her. 

Today could end up going terrible and I think I'd still come home happy. I'm glad I get to spend my life with this woman. We grew up 7,000 miles apart but now I don't even want to leave the house without her. The human experience is weird like that I guess.

"Guys playing in the park kicked the ball over the park fence and my fence. I heard it from my bed when it hit the bushes so I woke up and went outside. I could already hear them chastising each other for kicking so hard. I threw the ball back with all my might.

I Got to Meet my Favorite Musician Marlon Funaki Last Night!!!! I’ve been listening to his stuff for about two years and recently saw that he was going on tour. I was immediately ecstatic when I saw Chicago in the locations! I went with a buddy and we both had separate chances to talk with him one on one. I was the last person in line to get a pic/sign stuff and was very lucky to chop it up with him for a few minutes. I was absolutely star struck but kept myself together enough to have a decent conversation with the man lol. My buddy ran into him in the bathroom as the place was closing up and told me that he stopped at the door after drying his hands to keep talking with him. Amazing guy. I still can’t entirely keep my composure 24 hours later. He said “I’ll see ya at the next one” and he is absolutely right. I wanna throw up and cry 🤣,excited,Happy
"It’s never too late to start over…I have written this title so many times but it has to be longer so here I am, making it longer so it doesn’t get removed. It’s Never Too Late 💜

No matter how far you’ve gone in one direction, you’re allowed to turn around. Life doesn’t come with a deadline for change. You can begin again at 25, 40, or 65. Whether it’s walking away from what no longer serves you, healing from the past, or chasing something you thought you missed your chance at, starting over is a sign of strength, not failure.

You’re not behind. You’re just beginning a new chapter, and that’s a powerful place to be.",excited,Happy

* Had breakfast with a good friend. Caught up on the happenings over the past few days and just general chit chat. Some people are good people and are easy to talk to and actually listen. It was great to hear him talk about his meeting and how he got to hang with the Superintendent. Making a great impression.

"I found a teacup I've been looking for for nearly thirty years My stepdad's mom was the best lady. Cute little Canadian woman who was the polar opposite of the elder Mississippian women I was used to. We got on like a house on fire and she got me into drinking hot tea while I lived in Canada. She had a collection of individual antique teacups and this one was my favorite, so she gave it to me. It got lost to hurricane damage the year after it was given to me and I've scoured the internet and various antique stores for another. I even found a smaller cup and saucer (demitasse) with the same couple and bought that.

Then, last week I entered one of the same search strings I've been using for years into Etsy, where I have been entering it for years, and there was the cup for eleven bucks. It even came from a Canadian seller. I bawled like a baby when I opened it.",excited,Happy
"08/04/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy * I had a lovely interaction with two people who work at the car assessor place for insurance claims. Just really nice and happy. The receptionist complimented my shirt design saying it looked like a gym shirt and that she'd wear it to the gym. It is my business logo, so that means that she loves my design. And the guy was just really nice in general. We spoke about things for a few minutes, but it was a great interaction.
* A good friend of mine put in the effort and did really well on her exam. Its the effort she put in, not luck that got her a great result. I love the confidence in the results. It make me super happy that she's doing really well at something she loves.
* A mate of mine is falling in love, it is so good to see. He is getting really close to his interest and it is heart warming to see the love blossom. At our age it is more and more difficult to find someone that is looking for something special. So I am so happy he's found a like minded individual.

"After 6 years of feeling in a fog, I’m finally feeling like myself again. I’ve felt this way for a long time, kinda hovering or trapped in my own head and thoughts and my own toxic behavior. A lot has happened to me in those years that made me feel unsafe to share those thoughts or let me feel like I could fully express my everything. Until recently. I’ve cleared out negative people in my life, set more clear boundaries, reexamined my feelings towards the people who I thought were against me for a long time and now have a better relationship than ever with them, I’m single for the first time in a long time and for once I’m actually starting to like myself. I’m starting to want to draw more and get back to the things I used to love, reimagining things and making them better, making more music. I was in such a weird place that I didn’t even have that many dreams but lately it’s been one after the other, all of them vibrant and giving me more hope for the future. I don’t think I’m really ready to date again quite yet but I’m so happy that im taking this time to really explore me as a person. I know this is a very self indulgent rant but I feel like I have to take more ownership of what I’m feeling and tell more people and make it feel more real that this is where I am. Thank you for listening!! I don’t know what the future holds but right now. I’m happy :)",excited,Happy
"Local Restaurant in my town gave me my favorite food for free It's been 7 years of me going to this restaurant, and they always give me freebies whenever they saw me coming. This day, the delivery guy from this restaurant suddenly knocks on my door and gave me my favorite food that I always order. At first, I thought they've got the wrong address and I clarified that I didn't order anything. Turns out, it is free from the local restaurant because they notice that I always order one specific food and most of the time this dish is always out of stock. 

Now, I am thinking if I should celebrate my college graduation here too since I already celebrate my high school graduation in there lol

Anyway, this is the first time I feel wholesome because someone did something like this for me. Thank you my humble local restaurant!",excited,Happy

Bit of context: I’m a musician by trade. 10 years ago I got asked to play a character in a musical because I could sing and play guitar, this was my gateway! Over the last 3 years I’ve done plays and dramas to improve my acting abilities. This year, I auditioned for a role which I didn’t expect to get but the fact I did it without friends was a huge leap for me. I was honoured to have been offered the lead role and I’ve made new friends throughout the process!! ",excited,Happy

"From TikTok Refugee to Wholesome Internet Story A few months ago, I was kinda a TikTok refugee and somehow ended up on RedNote. It was honestly pretty wild—at the time, the app didn’t even have a translation feature. But I still managed to connect with people there using super basic English. There were barely any ads, and it felt like this weird little peaceful corner of the internet. Then I came across this story that honestly gave me chills (in a good way). There’s this guy from Mississippi named Brecken—he posted for the first time on RedNote with a picture of him and his 14-month-old daughter, just saying “hi.” And out of nowhere, thousands of Chinese users replied with photos of their own families. It totally blew up. One of the top replies came from a Chinese family called “A Tiu,” and they actually became friends. Brecken and his family were so touched by the connection, they decided to fly to China to meet them......

Well... stuff like this makes the internet feel human again. Social media is so chaotic now. Anyone else remember a time when it felt more like this?",excited,Happy

"Make them suffer appreciation thread/ happiness: Hey there everyone.  I just wanted to make a post about my favorite band ever and how much they make me happy.  I just recently saw them last month.  They’re a metalcore band from Western Australia 🇦🇺 and a lot of their songs have helped me through so much.  During the pandemic and especially the last couple of years, they’ve helped me cope with a lot of changes that have happened in my life.  I truly appreciate how they’re music helped me turn my pain into something more productive and worth doing.  Meeting some of the members was truly a blessing and how nice they each were to me.  It was recently my birthday on the 3rd and I thank them for helping me get to that point each year.

Have an amazing day, Redditors!",excited,Happy
"Just saw the most wonderful thing from a group of young guys Was on the front porch of a bar/restaurant. Outskirts of a big city so pretty popular with a lot of local college students etc. This group of 4 young men (maybe 18-22?) were hanging out talking about the MLB (for non-Americans, that’s our pro baseball league) games from earlier that day. One of the guys was pretty clearly autistic/Asperger’s and seemed to be close to one of them. He didn’t seem to really understand and didn’t add anything to the baseball convo but all the guys kept explaining the baseball news in terms of trains - which seemed to be the other guy’s special interest. They mentioned an upset and one of them said “Josh, that’s like a steam engine beating one of those fast Japanese trains in a race” and he got pretty excited. It was just super cool to see they were including him and taking the time to explain everything they were talking about in familiar terms. 

Edit: Don’t think I’m on the right sub, sorry about that but just wanted to share ",excited,Happy

"I found a way to make my weeks less dull and depressing! I used to feel stuck in a loop, waiting all week for the weekend, only for it to disappear in a flash. I realized I left all the fun for those two days, which is why the weekdays felt so dull and depressing. 

To change that, I started “Pastry Wednesdays,” treating myself to a small pastry every Wednesday. It actually made a difference, the week feels shorter, and I’m not just counting down to the weekend. Now, I’m trying to add more little joys to my week, but most of my hobbies take too much time and would just leave me even more exhausted.",excited,Happy

"My son (of the cat variety) came back after 3 weeks! So I have this precious kitty, his name is Joseph Scute Swarm Biden (scooter for short, Joseph when I'm moving him away from my food lol), 7 yrs, who went missing recently. 

 I recently moved back in with my dad and they have severe allergies, so Scooter and my other cat stay in my room. 

I left my house and let my brother go pet him in my room, as long as he kept the door closed. My brother accidentally left the door cracked, and the family dog got in, scaring  scooter, who found his way into the walls. I tried everything, wet food, water, litter by the hole in the wall. Eventually, there was a smell in the house and I accepted and mourned him, and it absolutely killed me.

Earlier today, I walked into the bathroom, where the hole was, and he was standing by the tub, scared out of his mind, skin and bones, before he ran back into the wall, but stayed right next to the hole.

Wet food worked this time, and he let me just carry him on back to my room, scared as he was, and immediately got to work on the water bowl lol. 

Im so incredibly happy, my boy is back and cuddly as ever, still adjusting but alive.

"I started physical therapy and no longer throw up in the morning After two decades of visiting different doctors, I finally got my remaining health problems treated and diagnosed! 

Today was the first day I got up in the morning without throwing up or dry heaving or any joint dislocations and I’m so so so happy. Feel like I could literally explode with joy.

I am so grateful to all my friends and family who came by to check on me, brought me food or helped me with physical tasks that I couldn’t do and just otherwise make sure I could still lead a life with dignity, and I can’t wait to be back on my feet to hug every single wonderful one of them.

"My birthday party with my friends was so fun!!!!! Hello everyone! Recently i made a post here about how excited i am for my 18th birthday party with friends. Long story short, i decided to invite two of my friends (let's name them T and S) over to my house on monday, a day after my birthday. My family was going to go somewhere so we can party on our own. 
Here's how it went:
We met up near my house to go buy wine. They gave me a bouquet of tulips and a present which i checked out later. We arrived at the convenience store and picked a bottle of wine as well as one energy drink (energy drinks are also only legal from 18yo in my country). We went to the cash register and obviously i was asked to show my ID. I showed it immediately and what the cashier said kind of shocked me. ""It's obviously a forged ID"" she said. I gave it to her so she can check it out properly but she said ""there should be a flag in the corner"". I told her that maybe it's not there because the ID was made in 2018. She was not convinced, but another lady from the store came and said there doesn't have to be a flag. I also showed my legitimation and she finally sighed and sold me the stuff. We laughed at it on our way to my house. I had earlier inflated two huge colorful ballons that said '1' and '8' and hanged it next to each other. I also hanged some more ballons and i set the whole table with food and party things like sparklers, glow sticks, party hats, party trumpets and so on. I also washed the wine glasses and put them on the table. So it looked real party-like. I was so excited when we arrived. My friends bought me a special party hat that i put on immediately. They put on their party hats and sat down on the couch. I put the wine on the table and went to the kitchen. I pulled the birthday cake out the fridge, lighted my candle in the shape of '18' and carried it to the room. They started clapping and singing happy birthday. They recorded me blowing out the candles too. After that, i cut the cake and gave everyone a piece. We were dining and then we remembered the wine. We opened it and i poured everyone a glass. I put only a little bit in mine, just to taste it. I didn't like it as expected, but my friends did and that made me happy. I then decided to get another wine that my parents bought the other day (they allowed me to share it). It had a cork and none of us had any idea how to open it, even with the cork opener. Finally we figured it out and we were super happy. I didn't like the taste of this one as well and according to my friends it wasn't that great either, but they did drink some. We then had a long photo session. We took LOTS of photos, some while holding two wine bottles. It was SO FUN!!! We used the glow sticks, glow rings and sparkles. I also blew some bubbles for the photos. We turned the music on, turned the lights off and turned on a small disco ball that I prepared. We danced and sang. One of my friends started drinking the wine i bought straight from the bottle and got a bit drunk, but it wore off after an hour or so. Later i checked out the present i got from T and S. I got a my favorite sweets, a 100$ GIFTCARD to a mall and A SILVER BRACELET WITH MY INITIAL AND A LUCKY CLOVER!!! I was genuinely so happy and i hugged them. A couple hours i texted my mom that she, dad and my brother can come back home since we partied enough and it was late already. We cleaned up a bit and soon my family came back as we were getting ready to leave. We then went to T's house and i on the way i bought them both energy drinks. The cashier didn't have any problem with my ID. We arrived at T's house and told their parents everything about how the party went. Soon S's parents picked her up and since it was late, i too left after a while. I went home all happy and even today, a day after the party, i am very happy. Truly, it might be the most fun I've ever had. I'm so glad my 18th birthday was so special. :D

PS: the party with my aunt and uncle went super awesome too. I got awesome gifts and they were super kind and funny. My dad was in another city at the time, and i was kinda sad he wasn't going to be there on my 18th birthday. My mom texted him that I'm sad, but he already decided he's not going to come because his work will get delayed and i didn't try to convince him earlier, so now he had no way to come. But guess what - he caught the train last minute, paid 20$ more for the ticket, stood in the train for 2 and a half hours (there were no seats left) and surprised everyone as he entered the house with a bouquet of 9 roses. I WAS SO HAPPY he literally did all that just for me even though he knew he'd have to go back the next day. We used to have a not-so-good relationship but recently he really became a dad, not just a father. And the fact that he did that for me just shows he really cares and I'm overjoyed!!! :DD",excited,Happy
"01/04/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy * The lounge we purchased got delivered nice and early so I had all day to put it together.
* The delivery guys put the new lounge in our lounge room, they didn't have to as they only had to put in on the driveway, but they put it in our house which was really nice of them.
* No client work today so I got to chill and focus on my lounge (as you can see, todays post is mostly nah, all about the lounge!)
* I needed some help with the final stages of my lounge construction, I called my mate up and within 5 minutes he was reversing up my driveway and helping me out. we bounced ideas, got to work. figured it out and made the whole project solid. A few jokes about screwing tight and laughs and next minute, lounge is done and we're watching the Telly. 
* Today was a good day, fully lounge focused. ",excited,Happy
"i started my new job today and I didn't die!!! A few months ago I nailed a job interview at a language school and today I had my first class. 

I spent an hour with 1st and 2nd graders trying to convince them that learning English can be really fun.

I was so nervous I almost threw up. Then I had some parents who wanted to watch the class and it made me even more scared. Also the kids were so smart I had to improvise harder tasks for them lol 

but my god, it was so worth it!!!!

I always said I wouldn't be good at teaching and stayed away from giving private lessons, and honestly getting this job made me realize this was a dream I didn't even know I had 

I have 3 more days of similar classes and I can't wait!!!

(I'd also like to give myself bonus points for finding myself around the kids' school and being brave enough to ask someone for help) ",excited,Happy
"Pizzeria wrote ""30"" on my pizza because apparently my 30th birthday coincides with their 30th anniversary This pizzeria I sometimes use needs your age (date of birth as well) due to the fact they also sell beer.

Apparently, their 30th anniversary coincides with when I was born (June 95') so they wrote 30 on my pizza with dressing that usually comes in a criss-cross pattern

I went to bingo and won absolutely nothing today so the fact they did this made me very happy

"I’m no longer people’s emotional pillow and I’ve never been happier! I don’t wanna dive deep into my childhood and make this any longer than I want it to be but I was always a people’s person. 


I lacked in recognising what I actually do, so I never understood or got why people thought I helped when I didn’t think I even did much? All I did was listen, I’d advise people about their situation and sometimes see it through with them till its end, till they’re okay and all good. 9 Years of listening and being the therapist caused me to have mountains of buildup in me. I noticed my behaviour was starting to become shifty, I was struggling, I’d find myself so upset and frustrated all the time but I just had no idea why. I’d have extreme ups and downs, I was unpredictable, unstable and angry. The confusion was driving me insane, I lost sight of who I was as a person, I was no longer able to determine whether I was someone fun or did I like subtle or what? Most the time I’d go for quiet and subtle cuz that was the only time I might get a minute for myself. But I’m more fun and interesting than I thought I was and having to find out about it now kinda makes me feel bad for missing out on me, but never too late!! 😋


I have a close relationship with my family, so I sat them down and for once I wanted to be heard, for once I wanted to speak out rather than the never ending blabbering I listened to all the time. I laid it all out there, I explained my feelings of confusion, anger and worry my soul is being broken down. I talked about literally everything. 



 After maybe a whole day or two worth of conversations, I decided I was gonna get my life back and own it relentlessly. I started with letting go, as in completely abandoning anything and everything that doesn’t serve me right. I don’t have to explain why I don’t wanna do something or why I’m a certain way or why I do the things that I do. I did it. I left and blocked people no matter what the fuck their mental state was cuz that’s their own responsibility, grow up and get the hell out of my way. For the people I might’ve felt bad for, I sent a clarification of no longer being interested in the connection and I was GONE. I left places that weren’t doing me any right, I cleaned up my social life and my whole life too to literally just end this, to just create my own space. I’m no longer a therapist or the friend some people desperately want in this life, man the hell up and do something about yourself cuz quite frankly I no longer give a shit. This is more relieving than you could ever imagine, I feel like there’s actual space in my head, I can think for myself, I can breathe. I can waste my whole day playing a game that upsets me cuz I keep on losing but I’m enjoying it million times more than being overwhelmed with paragraphs after paragraphs about things that don’t matter to me. I don’t care about people’s presence anymore, you got fucked up? What can I do about it 🤷🏻‍♀️


I’m taking a break right now, enjoying things I love, doing whatever I think about doing, having fun with my loved ones and I couldn’t be happier. I’m so relieved, so grateful and so excited for the new chapter to come. I’m not receiving anything right now, I just want my brain to settle and breathe for itself. When I’m done with my break I’ll only direct my energy, attention and efforts to God, myself and my loved ones, I must learn how to navigate friendships healthily now but for the time being I won’t allow anything to interfere with my energy. I deserve a fulfilling life, I deserve my own self and I deserve to be heard. If your life is not that good please get a therapist or talk to chatgpt, don’t depend and become over reliant on that listener friend cuz sooner than later they’ll get so lost in that fog and you don’t wanna be around them when they get the fuck out of it too. Anyways peace!! 😌✌🏻💜",excited,Happy
"I think I'm confident I can get a girlfriend I think in pretty pragmatic terms and I'd say I wear my heart on my sleeves simply because the way you react to my feelings is going to embrace you into my world or keep you out of it.

Yeah.

also I don't feel myself living a competition, I'm here to spend quality time, not fulfill your expectations.",excited,Happy

I'm in my 60's, in fairly good shape, constantly learning (not as fast...), and decided to stop working for corporate America. I've been privileged to live past 60, so 6 months ago, I decided health was the new wealth (especially mental health).

It doesn’t pay well as I’m still in my mid-twenties and coming in near the bottom of the totem pole, but it’s a VERY hard job to land, and it puts me on a career path towards a job title I never expected myself to be able to attain.

I cant really talk about it with people in my life because I dont want to come off as bragging but he is just so incredible. Sweet, gentle, kind, understanding, tuned in, caring, funny, strong, handsome, reliable... the list goes on and on. He has supported me through some truly unthinkable things and his love has transformed me as a person. My birthday was this past weekend and he made the whole weekend about us celebrating. He never keeps score or reminds me of when he made a sacrifice for her. He never belittles or puts me down. We dont even fight (just have really intense and challenging conversations which force us to see other perspectives and de-personalize the other persons actions). He is my best friend.

He is so much more than I could ever imagine a husband to be. I am so so so grateful to be his wife.

I have no idea how to show him/make him know just how much he means to me. I tell him and try to show him every single day. Hes snoring next to me right now and he just squeezed my leg in his sleep and it makes me smile so much. ",excited,Happy

"I'm super excited for my 18th birthday!!!!!!!! This Sunday I'll be 18 years old. My parents already planned a birthday party for me that the whole family will attend, but the party will be held during vacation. That being said, all the ""birthday budget"" went to that event. That meant i wasn't going to get anything big on the exact day i turn 18. Still, i wanted that day to be special. My mom said I'll still get a cake and that my aunt and uncle will come to visit. That made me happy, but i wanted to celebrate it with my friends too. I didn't know if i wanted to spend it with just my best friend or invite some other friends as well. If i invited more people it would probably cost more money... so I was thinking a lot and became troubled by what should i do. Finally i got a perfect idea. I decided that the next day (a day after my birthday) i will invite 3 of my friends over to my house (unfortunately it became 2 as one of them is going on a trip on that day). I offered to buy whatever alcohol they want (i probably won't drink anyway because i don't like the taste of alcohol). They chose wine. Tbh I'm super excited to buy it, not because i want to drink it, but because you have to be 18 to buy it nad I've NEVER bought anything that i couldn't buy legally. So it's gonna be my first ""you have to be 18"" purchase and i can't wait to pull out my ID when the cashier asks for it (especially since I don't really look 18). I'm so excited!!!! No one's gonna be home too, and I'll inflate the ballons and blow out the candles and it's gonna be so fun i literally can't wait!!!",excited,Happy

"Finally Getting Therapy and working on myself in ways i just never thought i could manage. I wont go into my whole history for personal reasons but there was a significant amount of trauma caused in my childhood that i am finally getting therapy for.

ive beem trying to get professional therapy since i was 12 and have been pushed around various different NHS systems hearing the phrase ""we arent right for you try _______"" over and over and over. At one point even waiting 2.5 years to hear from a team until i was told by them i was lost in their system because the person who did my assessment left the position before submitting my paperwork.

i moved out of my parents place into supported living in 2021 and spent about 3 years ""living free"" thinking i didnt need my meds anymore and that therapy was a waste of time because of how much i got fucked around but about 4 months ago i realised how much i was still struggling and searched for help because my behaviour was really damaging relationships i cared about and my own mental health

but after only a few weeks, i have new medication and my first therapy session in 3 weeks, im going to the gym regularly (which i mever thought id do), i have my own place and i have a new found family.

im still struggling with my MH and im really struggling to be proud of my accomplishments but i just wanted to make a record of it all because i am genuinely so happy and proud of myself but i cant bring myself to show it to people close to me.

"Hello Everybody. Over consumerism victim here, finally got treatment from a psychologist and free from the shackles of over-spending. Hello!

As the title says, I used to game a lot which in turn made me spend a lot more money on those video games. My excuse was that those video games where my ""hobbies"", that I did not smoke or drink thereby it was normal and that I had every right to basically spend that money on those stupid games. But the reality is that I was spending too much, and as someone who didn't have a job and just savings I had a grim wake up call eventually.

The issue starting when I got into MMORPGS, I was spending a lot of money, 400-500 euros a month on just those games, leaving me with only 50-100 euros to get food pretty much every month. My addiction spiralled out of control a few months ago which prompted me to use most of my life savings on a game called lost ark.

Lost ark is a korean mmorpg, and essentially the reason why I'd spend so much money is because of RMT. I'd basically spend money and since I was never caught breaking TOS and neither was any of my friends, I justified it in my brain that it was more and more worth to spend money since I got way bigger value than I did purchasing goods from the in-game store.

I basically created a lie that I was supporting individuals that needed to make a living from the game, which wasn't true, i was just feeding my self lies to feel better for myself, which was honestly a toxic trait of mine, and would definitely feed into future issues as I grew older.

Either way, My family realized my issues when they realized my bank account was draining abnormally quick. It got to the point where i'd siphon my money through crypto and lie to familly that I was just investing, and that I lost my money in investments.

Either way, My ex-gf, which god bless her convinced me to get into rehab regarding this matter with a fairly well known clinical psychologist in my area, which was expensive, but helped me massively with my issues. It took months of therapy but I am now cured of these accursed shackles of over-spending on shit that will not make my life better, but make someone elses life better.

I just had to realize that lost ark wasn't everything, sadly I lost the love of my life, but I am happy to see my self becoming a better person. Me and her are still friends, she is just scared in case I drop into my habbits again, so we decided to give distance until we can be sure I won't relapse, but I made sure to take the necessary steps to cut out mmorpgs from my life, and any gatcha related games, and stick to only single pllayer games without micro transactions.

Special thanks to Elden ring and black myth wukong, they helped during my therapy. It made me realize that games with micro transactions are not the only fun games. I grew up playing games with micro transactions since I was 8. Starting with old dragons nest on ipad, moving to AQW \[Adventure quest worlds, a browser game\] and then moving to other mmos such as, black desert, revolation online, AION, TERA ETC. 

Micro transactions are quite the poison if exposed from yough.

I hope that if any of you suffering from what I have suffered are able to get through this, and managed to get over your addictions. It can be quite tough if you do not have a supporting figure, but I really do hope that you see that it's slowly taking away the one thing you have left, and that is yourself.

"My life never really amounted to much, but I am happy to have successfully done something I can say I am proud of! Hello everybody!

To start, I used to just be your average standard white male, I was quite lost however from a young age because I did not really know what I wanted to do with my life.

High school was never really a fun time for me, I hated studying and in general had okay grades but in my IGCSES, and A levels, not really in school exams, those had been a disaster. I just kinda refused to follow the system because my professors didn't really treat me as a person it felt like, more like a pest?

Either way, I decided to apply to a local uni and managed to get into their psychology bachelor degree. I have to say that I never really wanted to study psychology, I always loved economics but was never really good at it, but nonetheless I tried my best and ended up receiving a 3.1/4 GPA which is quite good i'd say!

I started uni during 2020, and ending now in 2025, in my country its normally 4 years, but I had quite a few issues with my health during 2023-2024, which caused me to take fewer classes thereby extending my degree time. 

Either way, I am now doing my thesis, and finishing up this semester. I am quite happy with what I have achieved, mostly because I did not really think I'd amount to anything. I am of course a bit scared for the future, especially about my masters or if I want to work, or what to do really. 

But I really do wanna keep moving forward. Right now I am suffering with a weight issue, have been for my whole life, but in general I believe getting work for a year and focusing my main goal to losing the extra weight I have might be a priority than going for my masters.

Either way, feels kinda good that I managed to get my life into a certain path or to mean something really. A lot of males I am sure are also feeling lost as well as women, never give up brothers and sisters, hope we can all unite during these troubling times, and I hope you all find something that also makes you happy in life!",excited,Happy
"My friend, who loves the beach, was beyond happy with the way that I wrapped her birthday gift. I’ve had a rough weekend and bringing her joy brought me joy Saturday was my really good friend’s birthday brunch. She loves the beach. These past few weeks I have been having a really tough time personally with my father being sick. Gift wrapping was a nice distraction that helped me to feel a tiny bit better. I also was happy to see her smile when she took it out of the gift bag and saw the bubble and seaweed inspired wrapping paper. Bringing others joys sometimes is a pleasant distraction.

"24/05/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy - I trained legs and my knees feel pretty good! Not perfect, but pretty good. I feel so happy I can train legs again
- Watched a comedy special and the guy actually made me remember my dog, he was talking about how his dog passed away, man, I felt awful, I got so sad for a bit, but then I went through my old pics of my dog and because of that I also saw all there other pics and memories. Lots of fun times, me with a beard, me and my good mates getting on stage with HUGH BLOODY JACKMAN!! that was back in 2019 but I found a video. So good to go down memory lane and see everyone younger, my kids, my wife, and my poor pup, Amy. I'm not going to post any other update today as I want to end it on how awesome Amy was. She was a jack Russell, crossed with a Staffy. They called her a Jaffy, I called her a wombat. She would chase soccer balls around and control them better than I could. She had the best nature, loved sitting with us and loved being walked and let loose in a park. Everyone needs an Amy. She was so great. ",excited,Happy
"I would have given up if not for these three. My two best friends and One direction. One direction because there music helps me focus during hectic late night study sessions. And my best friends. I know people will think I am weird for saying this but One direction has helped me A Lot. Travelling everyday for 4 hours in huge train rush. Then 6-7 hours college, engineering studies, entrance exam studies (for masters), mini projects, practical files etc etc. Listening to them helps. 

And these two are probably only people who make me feel loved. I would have given up if not for them. ",excited,Happy
"Finally got a bed, slowly achieving my goals one by one! Finally got a bed, the floor is no more! (Pun intended) It's only a twin but it's enough for me. Queen sized sheets but they'll do. And my baby blanket.. next purchase when payday rolls around, a bed frame. 

Then maybe a TV. TV can definitely wait awhile though, picked up some books that the local library were tossing out, so that'll keep me occupied at night before bed for the time being. 

Since I've had to restart my life literally from ground zero again, I'm slowly achieving my goals one by one and it feels so good!! 

Edit: I bought this by completing offers on offer apps like True Finance and Copper. My first paycheck at my new job is next Friday. This week will be my second week at work. No, this isn't an ad for them, lol. Just wanted to share how I achieved my goals.

Edit 2: Wow, just 2 hours after sharing how happy I am after achieving my goals, the guy that's letting me stay in their home has a knock on the door. It's his landlord. Telling him that he's ""Sorry, but he's evicting him because at the end of next month he's selling the house to his daughter. Giving him until the 2nd week of April to find a new place to live. 

There once would have been a day that if I had heard that news, I would have just completely shut down, depressed, anxiety, feeling sorry for myself. But today, today those words gave me motivation. Motivation to keep moving forward, one foot in front of the other. I'm going to come up with some kind of plan, and ask the guy that's letting me stay here if we can work together and find another place together. That way, it's not as bad financially for the both of us. Life just threw us a nasty curveball but I have faith we're going to hit a home run! ",excited,Happy

"I haven't been admitted inpatient psych in over a year. I've been taking really good care of myself! :) 29F for context. I’m not sure where to put this, but I had a realization recently. I haven’t been to an inpatient psych hospital in over a year. I’ve had about 10 admissions in my life, since I was 19. Usually these are about once a year, sometimes twice, always for 1-2 weeks at a time. I’m thankful that I don’t have terribly complex issues, but I’ve had mental illness my entire adult life. But, I haven’t been inpatient for a while. I’ve been working really closely with my psychiatrist and therapist. I feel great, better than I’ve felt in years. I just wanted to share! ",excited,Happy

"Grew up in poverty, statistics not in my favor as a black man, but worked extremely hard and at 35 got what makes me happy! Using my throwaway because I don't want this to seem like an upvote grab. I grew up poor black child with a single white mom, dad has been in jail most of my life, with little to point to for role models or guidance. Don't get me wrong my mother was a good mom, always cared for us as best she could, but perpetuated the mistakes and poverty she grew up in. This was something I could not allow for myself or the life I wanted. I didn't excel in high school, but I wasn't dumb. I received a college scholarship for a 4-year engineering school based on my academics, that I grew up in poverty, and let's be honest, probably because I was a minority as well. My first semester at college was not a great one as I almost failed out because  I got caught up in the newness of it all (e.g, drinking, partying, being free, etc.). Unlike many of my peers, I didn't have family money to fall back on. So it was a wake up call. The following 3.5 years I killed it, recieving my B.S in Electrical Engineering.

When I graduated and started working, I was still lost a bit, but had the drive to utilize the Company i joined to my benefit. I got them to pay for my Masters in Eng. and subsequently my MBA. Around the time of my MBA I met my lovely wife, wh, like m,  grew up very poor; unlike me did not find the opportunities I had. However, this woman was the love of my life instantly because we connected on a level and vision in life you could not believe. She just never had the opportunities I had. So obviously we married, and 5 years later had a first born and subsequently 3 years later, our second. 

At this point, I have risen to a significant position of leadership in the Company i had stated with after college (12 years ago now). It is clear I now garner expertise internally and externally through my academics and industry acumen that means I will have gainful employment until I retire (even if move to another company).

 My salary awards me the opportunity to do something I could have never dreamed of when I was a kid. I have not only the flexibility with work to take vacations as I see fit but the funds to, on very short notice, take my family of 4 to Disney, Disney cruises, spontaneous trips, etc. I'm not rich, but we don't have to worry about losing our home, where our next meal is coming from, of we are saving enough for retirement, etc.

I dont say this to boast, but simply that as of right now 11:52 pm on the East cost of the United States I am crying tears of joy that the conversation i had with my self almost 20 year ago about what I wanted to accomplish and provide myself and my future family with has come to fruition. I cannot be any happier than I am right now.

I hope others find these opportunities as well!",excited,Happy

"i changed pretty much everything about myself but i feel way happier so when i started highschool i was going through a emo sort of phase and i cut of all my hair and wore really thick eyeliner and i didnt care about what other people thought of me, that may sound good but it wasnt. i had a really bad attitude with everyone, i didnt really care about personal hygiene or anything and i was just always in my room 24/7 and in school i was getting bullied a lot. 

  
about a year in to highschool i started feeling insecure and it really affected my mental health so i started focusing on myself a bit more and literally everything in my life has gotten way better. ive started doing makeup and skincare, ive been growing out my hair, ive started hanging out with my friends and family a lot more, i dont ever get bullied anymore, i feel like ive been a lot kinder to people and yeah just everythings really good now and i just wanted to post this somewhere :) im just like really proud of how ive flipped everything over in my life

"Friends for 15 years then dating since 2023 and now engaged! I've known my NOW FIANCÉ (!!!) through many important chapters of my adult life. Our friendship grew into more when the time was right and now we're engaged! He proposed to me while we were on vacation in Slovenia. We were sitting next to a campfire with a frontrow view of the Julian Alps. No one else around. No camera. Just us, the nightsky, and love. 

And as someone who is obsessed with bugs and likes non-flashy things, he got the perfect ring for me.

"Lighter my situation with my exes and friends since December 2024 really messed me up. I started seeing life in black & white. I had no hope, I hated people, and I just wanted to stay away. I carried the pain people inflicted on me everywhere I went.

I also hated being “by myself.” I couldn’t stand the fact that people wouldn’t show up for me—I didn’t understand why I was the only one showing up for myself. So I took people with me everywhere, from the gym to Reddit to friends, just trying to fill that space.

But now? I feel lighter. There’s a lightness within me. I’ve finally healed, and I’m finally okay.

I see life in colour again. I walk in faith, in belief. I show up for myself. I’ve stopped making everything about me and realised that life isn’t happening to me—it’s happening for me.

I really pray everyone reaches this stage—this stage of possibility, this stage of peace. And above all else, hope & joy.",excited,Happy

"I was unsure on how I was going to afford my bridesmaid dress, but it turns out the bride already had me covered - kindest friend ever! I'm a bridesmaid for one of my closest friends whose wedding is this year. We had a group wedding planning call yesterday in which bridesmaid dresses were one of the topics of discussion. The bride would like us to choose a dress style that we like from a local South African bridesmaid shop in the colour that she has picked out (a gorgeous champaign colour).

I felt despondent after the call because business is currently so slow that I'm needing to cut anything non-essential... I didn't know how to even think about adding the cost of a really pricey bridesmaid dress to the mix. I resolved to hope and trust that things would work out. I wouldn't let this be the bride's concern. 

The bride and I had our catch up call today and inevitably chatted about the wedding. She  offered to cover the cost of my bridesmaid dress as she was aware of how things have been going with work for me. We'll work out a way for me to pay her back when business picks up again later this year. 

I'm so ridiculously overjoyed by the kindness, consideration, and simple awesomeness. I will get to be a part of her day and celebrate this sweet, strong woman that I have the privilege to call my friend. ",excited,Happy

"One year later, after making the best decision of my life, I am so much happier. I still struggle in many ways, but damn it sure is easier when you're clearheaded all the time. One Year 

Each year on this day I usually make a sláinte and happy birthday Pops post on the socials. Not today. Well, still happy birthday and I love you Pops, but times have changed old man. I did something that you never figured out how to do. 

Today marks a year that I decided I was done drinking. I don't want or deserve any kudos for it, so please don't give them to me. It has not been difficult at all and I don't miss it in the slightest. It's honestly been arguably the easiest big decision I've ever made in my life, and this past year my decision has been reinforced countless times as I have watched many others, too damn many, people that I love so fucking much, destroy their lives with substance abuse. None more than alcohol. It has been horrible to watch happen and to be so powerless to stop it.   

What I do want to talk about is how crazy it is the way people behave when they find out you don't drink. With no other substance do people behave in the same manner as alcohol. When you say, ""I don't drink"", everyone asks you ""Why?!"", or ""Are you an addict?"", ""In recovery?"", or any number of other similar questions, and they then almost universally encourage you to join them and imbibe. 

Why is that? 

Nobody ever even asks if you do heroin, crack, or whatever. If they did for some reason ask, and you replied in the negative, nobody would ask why you don't, like you're somehow weird for not doing so. Alcohol is one of the worst drugs we have (the worst?) and the most common life destroyer among us, yet we are treated as though you're a social outcast if you choose not to use it and we celebrate its use in media, entertainment, and society at large. It's so fuckin weird. 

Yes, I have been guilty of that behavior too. In fact, I am personally responsible for one of the people that I love most on this planet starting down that path of alcohol abuse. Something that I will never forgive myself for. She got out, fortunately, but not before it almost ruined her life, and then my continued use was a huge factor in me losing her. One of the most wonderful people I've ever known and the best and most loyal person that I have ever had in my life. 

I'm so sorry. 
 
But I digress. 

I have had close friends, and even relatives, spend significant time trying to convince me to drink with them at gatherings, holidays, to go out to drinking with them, whatever. When I decline they ask me ""What's wrong?"", and ""Don't you want to have fun?"", or, or, or. I've thought about it a lot, both my past behavior in this regard, and watching others since I quit, and it seems to me that we are looking for affirmation that we are doing the right thing by drinking. That when someone isn't drinking with us, that it shows us in a negative light, holds up a mirror we don't want to look in, and maybe puts doubts as to the correctness of our behavior. I don't know, maybe I am way off, but whatever it is that causes it, it's a real thing. It's fuckin wild to watch happen. 

Anyways, I am not ""sober"", and I am not here saying that I will never drink a drop again, but I cannot imagine a reason that I would do so and I certainly will never again make drinking or being a fuckin drunk part of my identity. 

Decades late, but I have finally decided to let go of my trauma and just live this life I have. I have never felt freer, during the worst and hardest year of my life, THE FUCKING WORST, I have been happier than I have ever been. I know that would not be true had I been drunk. 

I'm not here to judge you, or to ""tell"" you to quit, but if you've considered that you might want or need to do so, I would encourage you to give it a shot. 

""Not drinking has given me everything alcohol promised.""

Finally. ",excited,Happy

"After four years of struggle and loneliness i'm feeling happy :) (Please don't mind the weird English, it's not my first language)

It’s been two months since I landed my first job and six months since I graduated. Back in college, I devoted 100% of my life to studying. I remember crying on the bus to university because, at the time, my life felt so bitter. I had no self-love or self-respect. Whenever a girl showed interest in me, I pushed her away, thinking she deserved someone better, someone who wasn’t just buried in books. But life is getting better. I met a really sweet girl, and we’ve been dating for a month now. Yesterday, I told her I’d be late because I had to take my mom somewhere, and she replied, ""Okay\~, I’m waiting for you in our bed."" That message made me so happy! Not just because of the intimacy, but also for the simple yet incredible feeling of knowing that someone is waiting for you after a long day.

Life has been good lately :')",excited,Happy
"Organized a mini block party last weekend and it was amazing My neighbors are friendly but we don’t talk much.

Decided to stop waiting for the “right” time and just tied invites on notecards to everyone’s door or mailbox. Ended up with about 10 of us eating chili in my front yard. Got to know folks a lot better and we even made plans to split a chip drop. 100% recommend :)",excited,Happy
"My friend and I started a Terraria world and he seems happier than ever. I’ve been wanting to try a more long-term game with him for a good while now. Talking to him is easiest while we’re gaming. My head tends to fog up when he and I are just talking, since my mind always lingers on how precious he is. Plus I enjoy just listening to him.

I recommended Terraria, and it turns out he’s a huge fan of the game, thank god. 
I had such a fun experience teaching him how to mod it, selecting some stuff he might like. And then some general useful stuff. He seemed so enthusiastic, having never modded the game before. He was excited like a child. Granted, so was I.

Unfortunately I had to go to work really soon after. We only had one hour or so.
But he texted me after that telling me he wanted to do it again ASAP. Tonight even. 

My mind has been sapped to that idea now for a good handful of hours now. It’s childish, getting so happy over a game of all things. But he makes it seem 10X more fun to play, just being around for it. I don’t know how he does it.",excited,Happy
"I started talking again with my friend after 1 year!! (sorry for the English, not my first language:3)
A year ago, a close friend and I ended up really mad at each other, and today, after we talked and both apologized, we started talking again. I'm so excited to update her about all this time and also to know what was about her. I'm really happy right now. I deal with depression and anxiety, although I'm much better now, and I'm usually in a bad mood, a little sad or indifferent. I was so used to it that I didn't remember how was to feel like this and it is so nice! 

I'm really happy and grateful I got another chance!!",excited,Happy

"This week has been nothing short of a miracle for me. Beating back agoraphobia after almost a decade. This week has been absolutely insane. I think my meds finally kicked in fully and I got the right opportunity with the right headspace to really try again. I wanted to list all my wins this past week to just see how far I've come. Mind you I used to be entirely housebound 7-8 years ago.

My maximum old distance I could normally go in the car before this week was roughly .4 miles, or 3 minutes in the car. This week I've gone the following distances and places.

Grocery store multiple times I havent been at in over 6 years, 1.2miles 5 mins one way  
Outback Steakhouse for a 2-3 hour sit down dinner also 6+ years, 1.9 miles 6 mins one way  
Gas Station I've never been to .8 miles, 2 mins one way  
Chinese food sitdown dinner, 1.2miles, 4 mins one way  
Bass Pro Shop 4.1miles, 13 mins one way  
Drug store 1.5miles, 4 mins one way  
Burger joint, 1.5miles, 5 mins one way  
Card shop, 3.9 miles 9 mins one way  
Social security **6.8 miles, 18 mins one way**

This week has been a fucking miracle, I have lived more in this singular week than I have in nearly a decade. I'm so happy I could cry, I'm so thankful for my Grandma and my wife for helping make it happen, I'm so thankful for my medication which gave me the room to breath to do this. I feel like I can keep going, I feel like I can keep trying, I feel like I can keep living.",excited,Happy
"I talked to my work buddies earlier, and it was pretty cool I work at a movie theater and earlier tonight I watched 'Novocaine"". It was a good movie In My Opinion. BUT right after I walked out of the theater and I talked to my coworkers. Actually my manager and a coworker. Someone I live with was coming to pick me up and me ""Sally"" and ""Rachel"" all talked for like 15 minutes! It was pretty cool! Sally said I was the last person in the theater like at ALL! which was even cooler in my opinion! Up until tonight I thought Rachel did not like me for a stupid reason BUT she was very jokey with me earlier! And of course Sally is very nice to talk to all the time! 

Its very strange since I thought I would not have any real coworker friends any time soon! Also I thought Rachel did not like me at all BUT it seems like she does after tonight!

I really look forward to seeing both of them this coming weekend! ",excited,Happy
"Im exited because i (14 yrs) just realised my friend really isn’t being fake, and she actually likes being my friend I thought this really nice girl didn’t like me—maybe she was just being polite. But when I asked if she wanted to be a Girl Scout monitor in a few years, she smiled and said, “Yeah! And with you.”

That moment changed everything. I realized she wasn’t fake at all—she was genuine and extraordinary. Now, I’m filled with anticipation, excited to see what adventures our future holds.",excited,Happy
"I got a dog and happy after a long time! While reading ""The unbearable lightness of being,"" I learned that animals follow ""circular time"", doing the same things, at the same time: dogs going for walks. The repetition gives them joy, throughout their life. Milan Kundera believes human time does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line.

That is why man cannot be happy: happiness is the longing for repetition.

On usual days, I wake up around 6 ish in the mornings. It has become a routine now. After my brief visits to the washroom, I come back to find my side of the bed hijacked by Goku, always. 

In the dark, he sleeps like a log, but his wagging tail gives it away (he thinks he's sly). It's a game we've been playing for months. The morning strolls last for 20-30 mins, ending only when he decides to poop. It's a small victory for me. Today, Goku had different plans. He took 50-55 mins, but didn't do the ""doody duty"". When all hopes were lost, we decided to take a selfie. He's proud of it.

Milan Kundera was right :)",excited,Happy

"“You don’t need to do anything. Just you being you is enough for me.” How do you even respond to such a statement?
It’s something my best friend had told me recently. He and I were kind of in our feels playing a game, chatting about life and our previous experience with people.

He told me I changed his view on how he wants to be treated, and I feel all the same as him. But when he told me that, I felt really self-conscious. I’m not very confident in myself at all. 
Hearing that made that feel even worse. Like steering a plane off-course when it was perfectly fine the way it was going. He and I are pretty open with each other, so I told him as much.

I told him hearing that scared me a little. That I didn’t feel I could provide much to him, for him to say something like that. And that’s when he told me, well, that. That we don’t necessarily need to give each other anything for our friendship to matter. 

I could have cried at the time. Thinking of it even now makes me feel some kind of way. 
My only hope is to fully tell him the extent of what he’s meant to me, over our years-long friendship. Over these three months of fully-committed, dependent love. Thinking of him when I sleep, fireworks when I text him, helping each other through each long, hard day’s work.
I want him to know that I long to meet him in person, tackle him to the ground, show affection I’ve never been able to show.

Fuck. I know what he said, but I want to give him so much more than I do. He can tell me all he wants that he needs nothing from me, yet I can only feel in that I’ve never given enough, or anything for that matter.
I pray to whatever god there might be my feelings can reach him someday. I know this is something I’ll never be able to tell him. I’d probably sound crazy. Obsessed. But I don’t care.

He has reshaped my serotonin filter, putting himself at the front of it all. He tells me the feeling is mutual. 

I really, really hope that’s true.",excited,Happy

"I‘m so happy lately, it’s getting annoying. (In a good way) I can’t focus on anything, love meeting people, love being myself, love singing music out loud, love smiling, love crying from laughing, love reading, love binging movies and series, love learning, love my sport, love having made an academic comeback. Every day is a blessing recently and it’s weird, only downside is not being able to focus sometimes, because I want to get up and do sth. Else, even though I really want to do the neglected task. 

By doing things, instead of just doomscrolling I reignited old passions and found new ones (and it feels awesome).

"My new book is helping me get back into reading My OCD is really quite annoying. It’s kind of hard to explain, basically I count everything and assign everything to MLP characters. It affects me when I’m walking, eating and reading most importantly. Because of that third thing, I’ve been reading less. However, I got a new book and I am following my therapist suggestions of reading out loud. While it doesn’t get rid of my OCD, it minimizes it and I also have become really invested in the book.",excited,Happy

"Best compliment about food: ""it reminds me of home"" TL;DR: my brother's GF who grew up around mexicans said my burritos ""reminds her of home"" 

I made 11 chile Colorado burritos for myself because it had been too long since I made them and they take a long time to make. Since I had so many I thought I'd give one to a coworker and my brother. 

My coworker came and said ""that was phenomenal"" and said he's going to give me a cow tongue (don't knock it until you try it) to cook and share with him. 
My brother shared his with his GF who is from California and lived in a small farming community that was majority Mexican, they said it was absolutely amazing and that it tasted like ""real authentic Mexican food"" and ""reminded her of home"" which made me so damn happy because that is the top notch compliment one can receive about food. Anyways, I'm feeling really proud of myself and I am so happy it made someone else happy so I had to share how I feel. ",excited,Happy
"I think I really helped someone who needed it the other day I think I planted the seed of positivity into someone’s mind who needed it the other day

The other day at work(I work at a large retail store) I was ringing up a woman who was buying a large suitcase. I asked her if she was going on a trip soon, and she said yes, but instead of a happy excited expression on her face, she looked stressed. 

“I’m going to be gone for two weeks, and I don’t know how to do that. I don’t know how to be gone and away from home for that long.” She told me.

“Can I give you a piece of advice?” I said to her. She said please. I told her “It sounds simple, but just enjoy yourself. Whatever happens at home will be there when you get back, whether you’re stressing about it or not. So just enjoy yourself, wherever you are, whoever you’re with, whatever you’re looking at in that moment. Just enjoy it.” 

She paused and stared at me, like she was processing what I just said to her. “You know… I never thought of it like that.” I then watched as the stress and fear drained from her face and was slowly replaced with a sense of calm. “I think I’m going to do just that. I’m going to enjoy myself.”

It was clear that throughout whatever this random woman buying a suitcase was going through, not one person around her has ever told her to slow down and enjoy the ride. I can only hope that she does have the best two weeks away from home, and that her happiness can be found and spread, and that ripple effect continues. 

You never know what people are going through, and how just a simple reminder to enjoy every moment can truly transform the world around you. That small seed of positivity planted in someone’s heart can grow and bloom into a garden of happiness.",excited,Happy
"I sang my friend a lullaby on a Discord call and he actually fell asleep listening to it. He and I had been on call forever in the deep, deep hours of the night. He was reaching that level of tiredness where thought ceases and you’re just randomly saying bizarre stupid stuff for the hell of it.

I wanted him to sleep since he had work in a few hours and I didn’t want him going in tired. So when he went a quiet, I think he ran out of things to say, I started to sing You Are My Sunshine. He initially protested it, telling me he was no damn baby and whatnot.

But I kept going. Eventually he went completely silent, and after 10 minutes of him not saying anything, it was clear he had fallen asleep. I muted myself and stayed on call with him all night long. It’s so cute, guys. It is actually hard to put into words the fluttery feeling I got from that, and how embarrassed he was when he woke up.",excited,Happy
"12/03/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy * I took time out of my day to spend time with my daughter as she wanted to go shopping for her friend's birthday present. We went for a drive, had lunch, went to a few shops and talked the whole time, I really like spending one on one time with my kids and because she's my eldest and over 18, she's out a lot so finding this time can be difficult.
* I had a lead turn into a sale, it is going to be a good one as it is for the local rotary club, I am going to do it at cost as it is to raise money to bring awareness against violence against women in our local community. I want to help out as much as I can. Really happy that they chose me out of all the web designers in our area.
* I had such a fun time in chat with some old and new friends, lots of big belly laughs and just fun dumb stuff, I really enjoyed chatting with everyone today. Lot's of good fun, dumb times.
* Even though my wife and I both had a very busy day, we finally found 10 minutes at the end of the day to sit and talk and cuddle on the couch, we watched dumb reality TV and enjoyed each other's company. Great way to end the day.",excited,Happy

"My cat is okay!! Playing, eating, drinking, knocking stuff over again! My cat is okay!!

My two year old cat was acting really sick, stopped eating or drinking. He went from a super playful little demon child that sprints through the apartment destroying everything to just sitting very still, obviously in pain. We took him to the vet and he got meds, fluids, abx, appetite stimulant. A week later, he's back to normal. Has been purring and cuddling all night. And he started trying to destroy stuff in the apartment again. Just knocked over a chair. Never knew how much I missed the chaos until it stopped. 😭😭",excited,Happy

"I feel like I’m literally living my dream life right now I've always been a dreamer. My entire life, I've felt completely disconnected from my reality--like there was a layer of plexiglass between me and the world. My adolescence was hard. I lacked a lot. This past summer, I made the decision to completely start anew. I moved to the city, 4 hours from where I lived my entire life. I didn't know a single soul. I've dreamt of this moment since forever. I dreamt of living in a place I loved; I dreamt of successfully pursuing my ideal career; I dreamt of having friends, lots of them, that loved me for me; I dreamt of meeting the love of my life.

But although I am a dreamer, I am a realist. It's for that reason that shortly before my move, I had to have a serious conversation with myself. Yes dreams are fun, and hope is the basis for living, but realistically speaking, I said, this city may not be right for me, and the career I've always wanted is almost impossible to achieve, and having the friend group you've always wanted is unlikely, and the ""true love"" people talk about really only happens in the movies, and certainly not to a person like you.

Oh how wrong I was.

This city was made for me. It's only been 7 months, but I feel so deeply entrenched in the community and culture of this place. Not a moment goes by where there is nothing to do. It's so rich in diversity and character--nothing like the cookie-cutter town I grew up in. I want to live here forever. Finally, I feel at home.

Being an artist is hard, especially when the film industry is not in its prime. And yet, I've managed to find work on tons of movie sets. So much so, that I seldom apply for gigs. Instead, I am sought after, because finally, people notice my talent and work ethic, and want me to work with them. I've discovered my strengths and my niches that set me apart from others, but most importantly, I have a network of connections that will allow me to continue on my path to success. Even so, it never feels like work. It's the most fun I've ever had.

All I've ever wanted was a friend group. A lasting one; one where I felt loved and welcome; one where the others weren't embarrassed to call me their friend. And suddenly, I have that. I never spend a day alone. I am with people all the time, and they seek out my company. I've laughed so much these past months. Sometimes my cheeks hurt from smiling. I feel loved. I feel wanted. To be with people that explicitly tell you they love and appreciate you is jarring. I didn't know that was an option. And I didn't realize how easy it would be to say it back.

And then there's him. The literal day I moved, I met him, and I knew he was the one. I cant describe it. I'm a nihilist. I don't believe in fate, or soulmates (in the spiritual sense), but those who say ""when you know you know"" were right. And I know. We've been together for only 5 months now, but it feels like a lifetime. Like there was a part of me missing before I met him. He's made me a better person. He's made me realize how easy it is to love and be loved in return. Not a part of me doubts he is my person. Even the realist devil on my shoulder can't deny our connection. Since the day I met him 7 months ago, we have not gone a single day without talking. I have not gone a single hour without thinking of him. And the craziest part, is I know he feels the same. I believe him when he says he loves me. I've been wrong about many things in life--and hell, maybe I'm wrong about this too--but right here, right now, there is not a doubt in my mind that I will marry this man.

Years ago, I used to be into manifesting. I thought maybe then I could have control over my reality, and achieve the things I so desperately wanted. I gave up after I lost my spirituality. But now, I feel like I am living the life my teenage self was trying so desperately to actualize.

This is the life I've always wanted.",excited,Happy
"Attachment to intrusive thoughts is the main source of suffering Just somethings to note first (skip if wanted):  
\- I’m defining pain as psychological or physical harm that is unavoidable (e.g. the physical harm and psychological trauma from being stabbed), but suffering as psychological or physical harm that is avoidable (e.g. the oppressive thoughts about a social situation you fumbled).  
\- Also I’m focusing on the source of suffering from attachment as intrusive thoughts as this is what’s been the main source of suffering for myself (I don’t have OCD or other psychopathologies so this to me is changeable without therapy).

Suffering is from the minds attachment (e.g. once they enter our minds giving them our attention and ‘mental energy’) to problems not the problems themself, as attachment is what causes the harm through the emotional and cognitive burden it causes when thinking about a problem. Problems are permanently a part of our experience, they have a high a statistical probability of occurring and an even higher one of entering into your mind (due to seeing them as a threat), therefore to reduce suffering it is the attachment to the problems that needs to stop since the problems will never stop entering our minds (so trying to engage and change your perspective on the intrusive thought itself is pointless as the frequency of problems means there will always be another one to ‘solve’ - meaning the only solution is reducing attachemnt to the problem).

In order to apply this into real life each time I’ve had an intrusive thought (which upon reflecting I’ve found is quite often) about a perceived problem I’ve reminded myself that when I have intrusive thoughts about an issue it’s just another expression of that statistical probability, showing myself the futility in caring about the thoughts and the lack of significance it actually has since is just a predictable, normal part of life. Also I try to recognise that the greatest source of suffering is the attachment to the thought itself rather than the practical implications of the situation that causes the problem - all situations are inherently meaningless, it's our attachment to them which imposes meanings (such as cognitive distortions such as personalisation of perceived problems since attachment motivates more extreme emotional and cognitive responses) which lead to suffering. 

This isn’t about avoiding intrusive thoughts about problems (as this is counter intuitive since this can increase their ‘power’) but recognising them for what they actually are - as said, just an expression of that statistical probability that is also a primary source of suffering. Also reflecting on what’s the source of having the intrusive thoughts (e.g. an insecure-resistant attachment style) may be helpful as a first step in solving the cause instead of just focusing on reducing the symptoms.

"Been dreaming of this since I was eight years old. I \[21M\] have been storm chasing since the day I got my license on my 16th birthday. Only until recently (past couple years) have I been having large success and chasing with a friend of mine. As storm season rolled around this year I felt lonely and sad knowing I probably wouldn't have much time to chase with people this year. 

Well, he just asked me if I wanted to join his storm chasing group with actual storm chasing and research rigs. Of course I said yes because I have been dreaming of that since I was eight sitting on my couch watching Storm Chasers with my mom.

MY TOXIC ROOMMATE FINALLY MOVED OUT AND I COULDN’T BE HAPPIER WITH THIS CHANGE :) Hi everyone. It’s been one hell of a week with so much drama going on between me and my former roommate. For starters alot of stuff that happened between us was because of her and her actions. She decided to cut me off without talking about anything and today is when she finally moved into a different room. I was still sad tho because she couldn’t even look me in the eyes and apologize even when I heard our mutual friend getting mad at her for causing all of this to happen to begin with. But I’m just so happy to finally have that toxic person out of my room. I’ve noticed I’ve been taking care of myself more with her gone and been in top of work/ hobbies I haven’t done in a while. I love to read and haven’t done so in a while till now. Even tho I am getting therapy because of all that’s happened I still am happy to be moving forward and doing what’s best for me. Thanks for reading if you did I hope u have a wonderful day :),excited,Happy
"Made it to final round of interviews for moonshot job opportunity - happy regardless of outcome! A month or so ago, I saw a job posting on LinkedIn for a senior engineering role at a well-known San Francisco based company.  The combination of role and company peaked my interest. As I began to read the description, it dawned on me that I am definitely qualified for such a role. Two seconds later, I realized that there were well over 1k applicants just through LinkedIn alone. I thought, well shit, there's no chance - this is just a moonshot. Fuck it, though, I will apply.

This opportunity helped me find motivation and courage to finish and publish some technical articles and open-source code that I had in the works but never had the motivation to finish prior. I then updated my resume and sent off my application, not really expecting to hear anything. 

To my (legitimate) surprise, I heard back directly from a recruiter within THREE DAYS of submitting my application. Usually it takes weeks or longer to hear back, if you even hear back at all. We scheduled some time to chat, and it went well. Now, fast forward several weeks, and I just made it past my initial coding screening, and am moving into the final round which consists of four virtual interviews all back-to-back in the same day. 

At this point, even if I do not get an offer, this has served as such a huge motivation booster for me. I didn't even think I would hear back, but yet, out of over 1k applicants, here I am going into the final round. Plus, it helped me get over my fear of sharing my knowledge publicly, as I actually finished and published some articles/repositories. A win no matter what, and it makes me happy!",excited,Happy
"by the end of the month I’ll finally hit my biggest financial goal of the last several years (21F) Once my tax return hits my account and I get my next paycheque, I’ll have finally reach over $10k in my emergency fund account and also have extra to put towards my long term savings and family trip this year!! 

I know it’s not really a lot of money, but I only make minimum wage, and  the last couple years I made the mistake of putting myself in nearly 40k bad debt and it was really weighing on me.  I’ve had nearly 20k saved in my account at times because I’m an aggressive saver, but last year I was so tired of the debt and the interest that I decided to use almost my entire savings to pay off as much debt as I could, which was an scary decision for me but it was worth it to get out of that situation.  For the last year I have been working extra, and being really frugal and strict with my spending so that I can finally build back my savings from 0 and not have that anxiety looming over me. $10k with no debt feels so much better than that $20k with debt ever did.


I’m just really happy to have accomplished recovering from those bad decisions and no longer have that weight on my shoulders. I can finally use my money for my long term savings and financial goals instead of stupid debts. I can relax, I don’t need to work so hard and I no longer have to stress whenever I spend money on fun things. It’s a huge relief. I can move on to better things ",excited,Happy
"Working out consistently has changed my life Four months ago i quit smoking and started working out 3x a week - minimum. 

I had been addicted to weed for a little more than two years. I lost 40lbs in the span of a year, mostly because I prioritised smoking over eating or doing hobbies. I was high all the time except for work and when I met up with family. I wasn’t living, I was just staying alive. 

Now I work out 3-5 times a week, and I LOVE IT! I’ve started taking it more seriously, eating more protein, eating more in general, drinking water and getting enough rest. Also taking supplements like creatine and multi vitamins, and prioritising journaling and limiting social media. 

Im happy to say I feel better than I have in years. I’ve got more energy, more time for friends and family, and my head is clearer. Friends and family tell me I look better, and those that knew me well are pleasantly surprised with all the changes I’ve made for the better. 
I love my life, and seeing the gains is just more motivation to keep going. I can’t wait to see where I’m at in 3 months, 6 months, and a year!

Don’t know where I was going with this, but I’m very happy!

"For the first time in my life I finally got to pay for something for my parents A few days ago I went out to get something from my school with my dad. The road to my school was narrow and was getting worked on so we couldn't go by car.

Since I always take public transportation to get there I know how much to pay and stuff, being able to pay the driver for me and my dad felt so nice, tho I couldn't pay for the ride back since I ran out of change.

It was a small thing but I hope when I finally get a job I can buy them something more. ",excited,Happy

"First-round job interview tomorrow and I might for the first time ever get a job I actually like!! Didn't check my email for a few days after sending in the application because 1) I wasn't very hopeful and 2) previous employers have mostly contacted me by phone. Checked it today and saw a two-day-old email saying they would love to have me in for a first-round interview!! I was so jolted as I checked their open dates against the calendar - heart beating, mouth dry and everything lol. It's a new cafe that's about to open up soon and the owner seems like a cool person with appealing ideals for her business, AND the kind of social vibe that helps me feel at ease - the pay is good for the kind of job it is, too. She seems to be putting much more thought into the running of it than many businesses around here do, IMO. It's shaping up to be the kind of place that would get me as a customer even if they didn't hire me as an employee. But I'm hoping they hire me. We'll see! Anything could happen, my hiring is far from certain before I've even had a first interview, the business could turn out differently than my impression makes me expect - we live in that kind of world - but I'm just letting myself be excited and hopeful for now!",excited,Happy
"I am happy for the first time in years and it took a tragedy to get me there I am an autistic adult.

For the first time since do not know when, I am happy. I feel happy, my friends mention that my demeanor is happier, and just in general i feel better as a whole. 

But this scares me. I am not really sure how to explain it. But I have been miserable overall for so long, I am not used to this feeling.

I took care of my disabled mother for 11 years, this took a horrible toll on my life, emotionally. Since her passing in November, I have been working with autistic kids in a school, and absolutely love it. I wake up looking forward to work. On my days off, miss work.",excited,Happy
"My dad told me I was a great parent today. I'm a 30 father and I texted my father, that I loved him. And ussually whenever I do he believes I'm sad or somethings wrong. And he's ussually not wrong.

And he came back with the best response, and telling me how great a father I've turned out to be and everything. 

And I just want to say it made me happy. I know he knows in a good father, he's said it before. But the way he said it today made me so happy. If you have kids who are parents and you read this. And think the same thing of your kids. Tell them. It means alot to us. ",excited,Happy

"I'm the luckiest daughter ever and I love my parents I can't believe it took me so long to realize how amazing of a life they created for me.They did absolutely everything right and I have to stop taking all of it for granted and trying to find reasons to be sad.

My life is AMAZING and it's all because of them.

I always had food and a roof over my head.

They always steer me in the right direction without pressuring me. 

They did a fantastic job with saving and finances as young adults and that gave me a fantastic headstart in life.

and most importantly they gave me love.

I want to scream all of this from the rooftops everyday, but I realize that a lot of people never had any of it so I'm here writing this post.

Everyone deserves a life like this and I can't express how grateful I am to be ""the chosen one""'

"A childhood angel I never met again, a lasting memory When I was in 1st standard/grade, I studied in a private school in Kerala, India for just a month. I was a shy kid, and had a lot of social anxiety. In my class, there was this girl who used to smile at me every day, but we never really talked. Funny thing is, I never even asked her name, and to this day, I don’t know it. She was one of the few girls who didn’t bully others. I still remember—she had these tiny little hairs above her lips, which made her look even cuter.  

One day, after PT(physical training) period, I lost my pencil while playing on the ground. The next class after PT was maths, when I got back to class, I asked the classmates sitting beside me if they had an extra pencil, but they all had only one. Our maths teacher was very strict, not friendly at all. Class started ,she started writing on the board, noticed that I wasn’t writing, and asked me why. When I told her I lost my pencil, she got angry and started scolding me loudly in front of the whole class. Then she told everyone not to give me a pencil, if anyone dares to do the opposite she will beat them. I was on the verge of crying.  

Just then, another teacher came and called her outside and she left . 
As I sat there, feeling helpless, I suddenly felt a tap on my back. I turned around and saw that same girl holding out a pencil for me. She told me to take it. I was shocked, of all the people in the class, she was the only one who defied the teacher’s order. In that moment, her kindness meant everything. To our luck that the math teacher didn't come back,she and I were saved from scolding😅. I used the pencil, and before school ended, I returned it to her. I wish I had said more that day, but I was just a shy kid who didn’t know how to express gratitude properly.  

A few days later, I was transferred to another school, and that was the last time I ever saw her. But even after all these years, I still remember that moment. Life has taught me how rare it is to find such genuine kindness in the world.  That moment, her gesture—small as it may have seemed—stayed with me. Because now, as an adult, I realize how hard it is to find people like her in this world.

If by any chance you’re reading this, it’s highly unlikely, but still, I truly hope you’re doing well in life and you were one of the few people who showed kindness to me. And who knows? Maybe one day, we’ll meet again. ",excited,Happy

Now, jump cut to about maybe 12 hours ago where I went into the dentists office and got the FINAL cavity I had filled up!! 

I'm really proud of myself for keeping it up this long. I hope it lasts. I don't wanna fall back into that depressive state like before and I wanna be able to keep this up. I don't wanna go into adulthood not feeling mentally OK or not being able to take care of myself.. ",excited,Happy

Ok yesterday, my family and I had a celebration outside because my sisters and I passed all subjects and entered with honors. We had noodles, (DIY noodles) and I chose a spicy noodles with extra seafood and mmmmm it was yummy. And earlier we had shrimp for dinner. Idk if I'm happy because I passed the exams, or because I ate shrimp. In 10th grade my former best friend, (we'll call her the first letter of her name for privacy purposes) M and I used to cook foods in her house and our last food we cooked was buttered shrimp, which was our dinner in the family earlier. This was in 2023, and she and I lost touch, because we both have hectic schedules. The food is delicious and nostalgic, I passed my exams, I had bonding time with my family, and honestly, I kinda needed that break, due to the drama last Thursday (would prefer not to tell).

"I know the last time I picked up my kids One thing I heard / read (probably on Reddit somewhere) was that a parent picks up their kids many times over many years…but one of those times is the last time it ever happens and you just don’t know it. 

That seemed sad to me, so I made a promise to myself to note every time I picked up one of my kids. It was easy, just a note on my phone - I just needed the dedication to update the note each time. 

So now, my kids are too tall and heavy for me to pick up and carry, but I get a smile on my face every time I think about it because I know the exact date and time I last picked up both of my kids. 

My kids don’t know I have this happy little secret. I’ll probably tell them in a card for some special occasion, or I’ll leave it as a note in my will. But it makes me happy that I can definitively remember when I was last able to pick them up and carry them.",excited,Happy

Just got my first paycheck from my new job and I managed to get a motel that allows dog for a week. I was so reluctant at first on spending chunks of my paycheck but it was all worth it. I finally slept without worrying about my stuff getting stolen and not having to sleep with one eye open.

"My grandmother's cat is back home after being lost for over three months! My grandmother's indoor cat snuck out in November. My grandma is a widow who lives alone and this cat is an extremely beloved companion. She was devastated. And we were so scared for the cat with how cold and snowy it has been in our part of the country these past few weeks. Not to mention coyotes had been spotted in the neighborhood recently...

We tried a lot of the standard advice to find lost cats, made posters, reported her missing to local animal organizations and shelters, but nothing came of it. A neighbor saw her two weeks ago but she got scared and bolted when the neighbor tried to open their door to let her in.

Two days ago, we finally caught her in an old possum trap! She is very dirty, very skinny, very matted, and very tired, but she is home and safe. She slept and drank so much once she was brought inside. 

She has been to the vet and been treated for the eye and ear infections she picked up, and has been given a special food to gain weight back. Grandma says she is going back to her favorite places in the house and curling up in them. Just so, so happy she is back.",excited,Happy
"A random gymbro complimented me after I was underweight for my entire life My BMI has been in the lowest category for my entire life, I'm really fucking skinny and always have been, no matter what I tried. 

6 months ago after a breakup and her sleeping with someone else my self esteem was in the gutter, so I decided ""fuck this shit"" and started working out. 

We're now 6 months later where I have gone to the gym 3x/week, and yesterday a random buff guy in the gym and I started talking. 

He said he remembered when I first came in that I looked incredibly skinny, and that since then I've gotten alot bigger. He congratulated me on my progress and taking the step to start working out and hopes I can keep it up. 

That was a ""core memory unlocked"" moment right there, being complimented on my physique after feeling insecure about it my entire life.

"Today is such a good day and I just wanted to share. So nothing extremely exciting is currently happening at the moment but we finally moved and got a shit ton done since last Saturday! Now we just need a couch and little decorations and stuff. And I realise how silly this is going to sound but I did the majority on my own because my hubby is on a work trip and had to leave a few days after we moved here. He's going to be gone for a little over a week but I want to get as much done before he gets back. 

I've just never done any of this on my own before or really ever had my own place (long and sad story I will spare y'all from) but the amount of confidence I got from just setting up our WiFi, our TV, and kitchen stuff has made me feel more self sufficient and given me such a happy boost of well needed confidence. I'm just so happy and I can't share it with him yet because I want it all to be a surprise. We already picked out the stuff we want and most of it, other than the couch, will be here tomorrow! I might have to wait on some things because I'm sure I'm forgetting some things but the best part is that I found most of it for really cheap at Home Goods. I'm just really happy and wanted to share with strangers because this subreddit is so adorable. 


If you made it this far, thank you for reading! 


**Edit**: If it's not too much trouble and if anyone has any advice on what else I should get and feels comfortable sharing, please let me know! I also got hubs something but in the off chance he sees this, which I doubt it, I'm gonna keep that to myself. ",excited,Happy

I made distinguished honors society after struggling with school for years! For the past few years I’ve been struggling with school. I failed ninth grade almost twice. I’m technically a tenth grader when I should be an eleventh grader. I even gave in person a school after being online schooled since 5th grade due to bullying but to destroyed my mental health. Finally my parents an I decided to try this one  online school and I officially started after Christmas break. And I just found out yesterday I made distinguished honors society! After years of struggling with school I was super surprised to hear that. My parents are extremely proud of me and surprised as well. I guess I found the school for me!

"Took a baby step out of my comfort zone today and sharing my work for the first time :') Ok so even this is kind of scary to post but... I made a thing and I'm really happy about it! 🙈

I've always been really shy, I love creating, but I'd make stuff but keep it locked away because showing anyone felt absolutely terrifying.

But I had this idea for a simple planner app because I needed one for work (trying to figure out where all my time goes lol). Instead of just keeping it on my computer like usual, I thought ""hey, maybe someone else in the world would also find this helpful?""

So yeah, I'm sharing my work. It's called Timeleaf - just a cozy little weekly planner with time tracking. Nothing fancy, but it's mine and I'm kind of proud of it 🌱

This probably feels really silly, since I'm still posting anonymously - but still feels like overcoming some sort of mental barrier I've had for a long time, and I think I should celebrate it! Baby steps, right?

"I’m getting my appliances delivered today after 5 months in a camper from Hurricane Helene!!!! Man… it’s been a journey to get here.

Back in September, our house flooded with three feet of water. We had to buy a camper and live in it while the entire place was gutted and rebuilt from the ground up.

We’ve been eating takeout every single day because there was no way to cook in the camper. Laundry? That’s been a weekly laundromat trip since there was no space for a washer and dryer during the remodel. Even the little things—like a dishwasher or just having a mirror—were gone. You don’t realize how much those everyday luxuries mean until they’re taken away.

But today… today is a milestone.

After weeks of delays and backorders, our appliances are finally arriving. In an hour, we’ll have a fridge, a stove, a washer, a dryer—everything we’ve been missing. And once they’re in, we can finally get our countertops installed.

This has been a long, exhausting road, but man, I have never been more excited for a delivery in my life.",excited,Happy
"I got fired and I am happier than I've been in month! I worked for a company for 3 years where I would write articles for people who have moved abroad. It was honestly an amazing job. I was working from home (able to travel the world) most times, I got creative freedom to write any content I wanted. I built my schedule as long as it was meeting my hours. I made incredible connections. I had a fixed salary with benefits. 

What made it even better was this was my first corporate job coming out of university AND I got the right to stay in the country I studied in. 

Honestly, everything was really good! 



So, why am I so happy to get fired?

This job had a lot of great aspects to it, but in the end it came down to the people I worked with. Even working from home, I had meeting with my colleagues and I overall felt like I wasn't really apart of the team after awhile. I felt I couldn't ask questions or make mistakes, I wasn't growing and I just hated everytime Monday came around. 

So when they fired me, I was upset, but it felt like my biggest fear had come true. I would lose my residency and have to move back home (which isn't a bad option). However, even though it feels like I have a million things to do and I will have to leave this country, I feel free, happy, capable and ready to start something new. 

In the end, I don't have any bad blood with anyone, but I am kind of glad they fired me because it's giving me the push I need to become more. 

Side note, I realize I am so privileged! I have had amazing opportunities. I am in a better position than others. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. I hope you have a good day 😊",excited,Happy
"19/02/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy * My wife walked around topless for quite a long time this morning, it was a very good sight to wake up to
* My daughter needed to come home early and see and head to the hospital because she suffered a concussion. She was cleared and nothing was of concern. I did however have a really fun time with her for the 9 hours it took to get the final sign off and we left the hospital. We made fun of the silly things that happened and just made a few jokes and mucked around a little with the adjustable bed.
* I remembered my daughters date of birth all by myself!! ",excited,Happy

"I miss siomai and I couldn't help but feel nostalgic and happy. Is this normal? I miss siomai. I'm not sad about it, hahaha, I'm actually happy. We were doing homework about food editing, and I felt nostalgic when I saw siomai on Google, it's legit one of my favorites. I know, I know, it's childish to feel happy with food and that I'm too old for it, but I can't help but feel happy and nostalgic. My friends and I used to bond a lot about it, they also eat it from time to time, food's delicious, brings a lot of happy memories, honestly, I'm just really happy, idk why hahaha, has anyone else been this happy about food? Or am I exaggerating? Aside from it's delicious taste, it brings a lot of sentimental value. Idk man, I'm literally craving it rn. 

Update: I had siomai for breakfast today, one day after I posted this. What a coincidence. My parents did not know I'm craving it, yet still had siomai hehe. Love you mon & dad 🥰",excited,Happy
"silly and little and violent,finally I got my revenge against people that doesn't exist lol So, I have this thing in my head that makes me have existencial crisis against my core values, and two of them are: life is a serious thing ( not saying there's no humour), and moral.


And one time I was in this really bad crisis, and in my mind there where like five-four dudes that were making fun of me, that caused me a lot of the crisis, and I could see them laughing.

I finally got over it and then, some days ago, I had another crisis: another topic, another mental image of a guy.

(These mental images do a lot on worsening my state of peace)

And then it was like something made click on my mind, and I imagined the guy getting hurted, really hurted, like bear-hurted.

and then I remembered the four-five guys, and in my mind I hurted them like I would never hurt anyone in real life.

I realized with the another thought, that they were in *my* head, so I had the power to make them stop laughing, and that I had the power to make them bleed.

And, as they have hurted me, I wanted to really hurt them too.


I know this is not that serious of a thing, but finally feeling like I got a little revenge against that thoughts, really made me feel better",excited,Happy

"I’m so happy I’m regaining memories and mobility I’m 18 now and I’ve been dealing with a brain tumor since I was 13 1/2. I was going blind, I couldn’t get out of bed anymore and had migraines that had me screaming and sobbing for it to stop. The tumor erased almost all of my memories and I lost who I was and I couldn’t remember something somebody would have told me a couple hours prior. 2 weeks ago I got the clear that all of my levels are going to a normal teenage range and it’s shrinking dramatically. I may even get to stop my nightly shots eventually which is torture now that my scar tissue keeps building up. Lately I suddenly have regained all of my memories and I feel almost reborn. I’m cleaning my room again, I just moved houses and I’m actually getting things done when I never used to. I just wanted to share this with people to know that if you have a medical condition, sometimes there’s the hope that may come true of getting better. Even if it’s not fully recovered, it’ll get better. ❤️‍🩹 
EDIT:
Wow thank you so very much for everyone’s kind comments I really appreciate it!! I’m so excited for my future and what will come when I’m fully recovered 💕💕🫶

"True love really does exist and it’s just the small things that matters most. (Valley day dump) 
On Valley Day my man decided to gift me with 4 bouquet of flowers. I love roses so much but I have NEVER been gifted with 4 bouquets at once. He also bought me chocolates and I was VERY appreciative. We decided to go to cicis pizza (currently my fav spot for some odd reason right now) and play this game called It Takes Two on PS5. Lots of bonding and intimacy when we went to cicis. We just talk to one another love on one another. I just really appreciate him lots. I can't wait till we get married in the future.


P.S. Everytime he buys me flowers. I dry them out so we can use them at our wedding. The flower girl is gonna come down the aisle with them. Ofcourse we will spray paint the rose petals the color that we want so the rose petal will be in uniform. But BYE guys. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",excited,Happy

"I hosted a Galentine’s Day Tender Friends Chicken Tender Party and it was a huge success! It was a labor of love, and here I am looking very proud of my efforts 🥹 The party was complete with 3 flavors of homemade chicken tenders - Buffalo, Spicy Malaysian Red Curry, and Lemon Pepper. Below is everything else I made: 

* Arugula and shaved fennel salad with blood orange and Aleppo pepper vinaigrette

* Twice baked potatoes

* Cheese and meat and fruit plate

* Mocha mousse with homemade meringues

* Homemade red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting

* Batch espresso martinis

I also curated a good sleep, good skin self-care package for each guest which included a sleep mask, scarf, and skin cleanser set and chocolate truffles. My friend made homemade soaps for all the guests too. 

This was a bittersweet event as we were celebrating an upcoming wedding, our friend purchasing her first home, but also the going away of another friend so I went all out to make it a really special event for everyone. I started cooking the night before and it took all day starting at 7 AM to cook and assemble everything. 

I’m really proud of how the event turned out! It brings me a lot of joy to host gatherings and I don’t get to do it often enough. 

Also I promise the rose is NOT near the flame; it’s just the perspective of the photo. And we blew that one out shortly after the pic was taken 😜

"My landlord cares about me so much and really supports me I have been independent since Christmas.  I managed to move out of my abusive family's home into a rental situation where I would rent a bedroom in a house for 400 a month.  Pretty good deal in my opinion, because I won't have to pay bills, and I don't mind living in bedrooms since I lived a recluse lifestyle.  The landlord owns the house and lives with us, and let me tell you, he is just the coolest and most interesting dude.

First things first, I don't have a car, so I was worried about how I was going to move all of my stuff, and he legit offers to pick me up and help me move to his house and refuses my offer to pay him gas.  The entire time, he's kind, nice, and interesting.  He works a really badass job and is also a veteran.  I was so impressed by his house as he lives in basically a mansion in a gated community that has a golf course on it.  The house is nice af, and all the other roommates are so cool, clean, and quiet.  I made good friends with all of them and we help each other out with rides, we share snacks, that sort of thing.

My landlord is really kind and nice.  He didn't charge me until 2025 since it was so close to news years, and he was worried about me.  We had a huge snowstorm, and it was cold in my bedroom and I had no bedding.  My landlord bought me a spaceheater and a duvet comforter and told me I didn't have to pay him back.  He's so damn generous.  He always buys all of us snacks and offers to buy us stuff in general if the offer comes up.  He also does not judge me for not having a license or a car, and drives me places I need to go while also teaching me how to drive!  He doesn't even roll his eyes or anything.  

He also REALLY cares about me.  Last night, I missed college because I was unable to make it back to my dorm room before my landlord had work, and when he find me still home this morning asleep about to miss class, he had a legit angry MELTDOWN about me not being at school.  He legit yelled at me about my future, about how I need to take it seriously, about how important school is, and about how missing class too much could lead to dropping out.  He then drove me to school in time for me to not miss my classes, but before he did, he gave me tons of motivational speeches, apologized for his outbursts and explained the reason why it made him so mad which I won't explain but is entirely reasonable I assure you.  I actually blush that he cared so much about my future and I am not offended or scared of him for yelling at me .

When I used to think of landlords, I used to think of angry old men and grandmas who get angry over noise and serve evictions for everything, but my landlord is just a plain good man.",excited,Happy

"My students reminded me why I love my job. My graduating class is off to write their board exams and so yesterday they gifted me a huge card with individual messages (kind of like a yearbook, I suppose) full of the most affirming and heartwarming stuff I've ever read.

My favourite lines:


> You inspire me to explore new things, regardless of whether I'm good or bad at them, and you will forever remain an inspiration for me.

> You have always trusted me so much...I really didn't know we could do it on our own.

> I admire how you teach us with so much passion towards each story or poem and the depth with which we analyse them in class; that really helped me develop a liking towards English literature.

> I've felt free to express myself, which is something I struggle with in other classes. Your support has motivated me to do my best.

> Thank you for helping me find joy in the subject.

> I always look forward to your classes. They easily make for one of the best classes of my day.

> Your bold personality, open-mindedness and try [sic] and understand all perspectives, and self-confidence have been areas from which I have learned and implemented in my life.

> Ma'am your passion for English is contagious!

> I'm sure that if I ever seen reading comprehensions in the future I will remember the fun yet macabre passages you gave us through high school.

[Plus a few more possibly identifying notes about ""I remember when you did X"" which I shall not share...]

It's such a cliché to be a teacher and talk about how appreciation from the children will keep you going even if everything else is a chore and a pain but my goodness this was such a boost at a terrible time in the world. 😭

[There were also four or five with clearly repeated phrases strategically placed far away from each other on the card and that gave me a good chuckle, lol. You cannot be the shining beacon in everyone's life!]

We’re often caught up in showing love to others, but how about a little self-love this year? Treat yourself like you’re the person you’ve always wanted to date. Spoil yourself, send yourself a sweet message, watch your favorite movie with a tub of ice cream, and maybe even get yourself a cute little gift. You deserve it! 💕

"It all feels so easy after today and I think I am finally finding purpose I talked with many different people today and I am finding desire to continue living.

I was fully expecting today to be crap because of how it started with me not even wanting to get out of bed but I still somehow came to school, went the first two lessons then went to my mentors fully prepared on going home but one of them sat me down while the others left and it started with some bull-crap she was talking about but then I somehow stayed till after lunch because we ran into the school psychologist in the hall and she told me to see her after next lesson and I did. We talked about a bunch of stuff and I might be starting antidepressants after we talk some more!! I have met so many doctors before her but I really think she might be the best one. Now, it’s almost night and my chest literally feels light. It’s like I’ve gotten hope again. My mother even spoke about it she asked if I wanted to take antidepressants and I obviously said yes. Anything to make the episodes go away. Now, we are searching for a clinic to go to after next week when I’ve done a few tests. 

I am seriously so relieved to finally get somewhere with this diagnosis.

Someone among you might say “they are not depressed just fishing for attention” well fuck you too then lmao.
This is a summary of what happened today and I only put in the good parts, none of you know what I’ve gone through. But seriously, I do feel so much better than from what I did by the start of today and I’m actually feeling wellness, which I’ve literally thought was impossible for so long❤️‍🩹",excited,Happy

"Finally can pay the bills again after 2 years of hardship. My husband and I have been struggling with bills since 2023, when our job cut hours and we had to draw unemployment. Same thing happened last year and he even got laid off. Every time our check would hit our account we were -$500 or even -$700 on our account. We couldn't stay afloat and it was really hard on our marriage, happiness and goals in life.

Unexpectedly, on a froday night at 8:00pm, our new job afforded for people to go out of state. Our sister plant needed some help for a month or two. We agreed and both got picked to go. We have been here now two weeks and we are getting paid Friday. I'm so happy to say, while we are up here, our checks are more than double of what we make at home.

"31F - Trying to Stay Motivated and Positive – Help Me Shake Off These Bad Vibes! 🌞 Hey, hey you! 🙋‍♀️

So today… I woke up, and the universe clearly had other plans for me. Spent most of the day dodging bad vibes like they were bad pickup lines at the bar. 😅 But, as much as I tried, I’m *not* letting the mood win. The goals are still front and center, and that smile? Oh, it’s still shining (even if it’s a little more “I’m faking it till I make it” today 😏).

Positivity isn’t always easy, but hey – I’m here for the challenge. Today, I’m staying laser-focused on what’s ahead and not letting today’s funk throw me off track. We’ve got things to conquer, and I’m ready to look good while doing it. 💪

To all of you out there *slaying* the game and keeping those vibes high, even when the universe tries to rain on your parade – I see you, I admire you, and honestly, I’m *a little* jealous of your energy (teach me your ways, please 😜). You’re absolutely crushing it, and here I am just trying to keep my coffee from spilling. 🙃

Got any tips for staying motivated when you're *not* feeling it? Or maybe some fun ways you break out of a funk?

Stay stunning, stay unstoppable, and remember: You’re absolutely rocking it, even on the tough days. 💖",excited,Happy

"I’ve been with my fiancé for over a year and she still makes me just as happy as when we met! My fiancé makes me so happy!

Despite us being long distance, our communication and connection still remains unmatched! Over a year together has been the best time of my life and things are only going to get better in the future.

With our lives slowly converging, one day we won’t be long distance anymore and I’m so excited for that day to come. But until that day, I’ll keep working towards it until we’re finally there where we want to be. 

And I’ll get to visit her later this year, planning on spending 3 months with her and it’s going to be so nice. It’s going to be stressful, preparing everything and traveling across the world but it’s all going to be worth it to see her in person.

This happiness she gives me is so intense and I can only imagine how much better it’ll be when I’m with her in person. She’s truly the love of my life and I’m just so happy and glad that I’ve found my special person. She’s such a blessing ❤️",excited,Happy

"I’ve been feeling really happy about being with my boyfriend, so I wanted to share it with someone :> Hello! So I’m 20F and my boyfriend (I won’t say his real name) is 21 M, we have been dating for almost 6 months now (our anniversary is on the 23rd!!) and he is the light of my life. I’ve been through cheaters, manipulators, every bad thing in the book in my life and I just wanted to make a post of how grateful I am for him, he will probably never see this but just in case anyone wanted to read about what a good and healthy relationship truly is, this is the post for you. 
A little background on me, I have had very bad BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) since I was a child due to childhood issues and I’ve never met anyone who was willing to deal with it or even try to truly understand. 
He’s put it so much work to help me through it all, has never judged me or said anything was too much for him. He’s been patient with me, gentle, kind, everything I could ask for. 
I’m trying to make a career out of my poems, I haven’t told him this but I’ve shown him some poems and he always tears up at them, tells me on a random day how he re read some of them and how he always thinks of my voice when he reads them. 
He doesn’t even jokingly flirt with anyone, my best friend in the world always calls him his husband and my boyfriend always says “no I’m not, i only belong to (me)” and we all laugh. 
When we went out drinking, my friends and me were all giving each other lipstick stains on our hands for fun and my roommate gave him one on his hand, he instantly rubbed it off but kept all of mine even if they were all smudged and ugly. 

I tend to forget to eat, which causes me to get irritated easily so he always makes jokes how he’s going to keep a bar or some sort of small food for me at all times just in case, he keeps saying he’ll keep snickers bars (I’m allergic to nuts) and we laugh together. 
He always says how he loves the food where I’m from, I was born and raised in Mexico but I’m around 70% Arab and he always wants to eat food from Lebanon and Mexican food because he wants to learn more about both my cultures, we’re partially long distance so when he’s back to his home he tells me he made some tacos and how it always makes him think of my smile when I eat some good food.
He always says how he wants to cook for me, how he’ll bring breakfast into my bed when we live together, how he wants to try all the things I bake in the future and so much more. 
His family is absolutely wonderful as well, his father is the sweetest guy, his mother is such a fun gal to be with and his sister is so sweet and always seems to be happy about something just like him. 

We’ve had issues in the past about me thinking into things too much and making problems in my own head, he always sits me down immediately and lets me talk it out, he tells me what he’s thinking and we come to a understanding in both sides, it sounds so simple and silly but I’ve grown up with parents who only yelled and ignored any problems I tried to talk out so it’s very hard for me to voice concerns I have about some things. 

This post might be silly but I honestly just wanted to tell someone about all of this, my friends are all fed up with me talking about him all the time hahaha

**Sorry if the grammar in this post is all over the place, my English isn’t great**

He truly is my best friend, and the love of my life. So even if he will never see this, I wanted to thank him, and show all of you that love is such a wonderful thing, even if it isn’t a partner, maybe something as simple as love for a specific smell in the morning, a plushy you’ve had since you were little, a friend, heck even self love is such a beautiful thing. 
Good luck to whoever is reading this, I hope your day is going amazing and I hope the rest of your week is just as great! ",excited,Happy

"My husband is a success “again”! Again in quotes, because he’s *always* been a success in my eyes. Our household is in week #2 of someone being ill (or is it more like 3 weeks now? I can’t remember. Days & weeks have lost all sense of time)… the house itself is in dire need of cleaning & catching up… but I’ve never been happier!!!

So many great things are happening that far eclipse any negatives. We just got our oldest daughter (“Gwen, 17”) a car. Even though it was a 2.5 hour drive to get it (totally worth it, as it was a wonderful deal and a really great car for Gwen!). My parents have been so amazing in helping with the littles (“Aviva”, 7 and “Buzz”, 4 — they helped us out when I’ve been sick + we retrieved Gwen’s car), and they’re even talking about retiring in a couple years! I love my job. And my husband’s business is thriving. **His** company! (Gosh, that still feels amazing to say aloud!) 

This road has not been easy, but today I can confidently say it’s worth it. Just a small glimpse into what it took to get here though:

My husband (“Joe”) began working for an entrepreneurial company a little more than 2 years ago. He left a stable, guaranteed, really nice income (one that allowed me to be a SAHM) to have a chance for an ownership stake in this new company. I was fully supportive of this opportunity, for infinite reasons. But the biggest reason was because I knew that if Joe didn’t take this chance, he would always look back and wonder “what could have been?”

I wasn’t confident in the company itself, per se; I wasn’t **un**confident in it either. But I was sure of Joe and his abilities & resourcefulness. I knew that whatever came of this venture, it would lead to greater things. 

2023 was one of the hardest career-years that Joe ever experienced. He also lost his dad that year, which was so sad. That was also the year that Buzz turned 2. Terrible doesn’t even begin to describe that kiddo’s year! (Mostly kidding, I love that strong-willed, handsome little Joe-mini-me!)

Anyway, back to the work aspect. Imagine selling something that sounds “too good to be true” — nobody’s gonna bite on that fake bait, right?! That’s how Joe felt all too often that year. He has always been hugely successful in his outside B2B sales roles, so this really screwed with his head. Luckily Joe has made major headway in that company since then. I also went back to work full time in fall, 2023 (at a wonderful place with **great** benefits). And Joe gained even more success once he decided to create his own company in late 2023. 

I had been encouraging Joe to do his “own thing” for a long time, and for [very logical] reasons, he was always reluctant. But after I went to work full time, many of those reasons went out the window. We spitballed a lot ideas, and the more we talked about it the more feasible & real it became. I told him, if nothing else, just go ahead and create your LLC so you’re ready if an opportunity ever presents itself. 

By March of 2024, that’s exactly what happened. And by the end of last year, Joe & I were in a really good place financially. Very close to where his income was back in 2022 — except now he *owns* his own company! 

Actually the company is no longer an LLC; Joe’s company is now an S-Corp. Our accountant advised us that this is the best fiscal choice for our fam. Gwen is even planning on joining Joe on a work-trip later this year, so maybe she’ll become an official employee at some point. Oh yeah, Gwen graduated high school a semester early! Anyway, so many wonderful things happening!

I cannot wait to see the amazing things I’m sure Joe will accomplish this year! I am SO freaking proud of this man!!!!!",excited,Happy

"I finished my first week at my new job and I couldn't be happier I had been job searching for 6 months and had put in 18 applications with one specific company, and I finally landed (on my VERY LAST application, before I had decided I was going to take a break from job searching) what is essentially my dream job.

It's in a department that fits my education and interests, and my position specifically is *perfect* for someone with my skillset who's just starting out.

It pays the rate I wanted when I first started searching that I had slowly given up on over a few months of rejections.

My team is amazing. Just comparing to my last job, not only am I not the only cat person on my team, I'm not even the only person with a black cat. I'm not the only person with a nose ring. I'm not the only vegan.

Everyone has been incredibly warm and welcoming. I had a 25 minute conversation with my boss about our favorite true crime podcasts, documentaries, and financial scandals. I had a conversation with another coworker about the satire and feminism behind Pride and Prejudice. 

I don't feel ostracized as an ""alt"" girlie (visible tattoos, facial piercings, and vivid hair) in the corporate world which is absolutely mind boggling. 

And I already know a couple of people who work in other departments, so I'm making a ton of connections.

I found my place. I can already tell that I'm going to be valued and recognized for my work ethic and rewarded for my progress. And it's amazing.",excited,Happy

"My acne is finally disappearing after 3 years of trying to get rid of it. After dropping out of the self care part of my life from 13 up until last year, I was majorly depressed. I had horrible acne, I had a Pepsi addiction (which lead to cavities bc I never brushed my teeth) ND it was insane.

But just recently, I have a set routine to take care of myself, wash my face, brush my teeth, take care of myself. And my ACNE IS ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE!! after about like 7 months of washing it and applying the new topical my doctor recommended about maybe a month ago?? It's helped so much!! ",excited,Happy
"Three self editing tips that bring me fulfilment and happiness *Austin Kleon*’s book *Share Your Work!* *Austin Kleon*’s book *Share Your Work!* inspired me to start this blog. In a recent video, he said that he has a first draft of a new book. Before sharing his writing with anyone, he applies three self-editing techniques.

# 1. Give it time

>Time is a writer’s best friend. The work improves by being set aside and re-approached with fresh eyes. - *George Saunders*

*Austin* *Kleon* suggests, *You need to let it sit for at least a day. Put it in the drawer and go out the door and come back to look at it with fresh eyes.*

I keep multiple posts in different stages of drafting, allowing me to revisit them with a fresh perspective. This process helps refine my ideas and introduce new angles.

# 2. Print it out

>To write is human, to edit is divine. - *Stephen King*

Printing out a draft text and editing with a pencil in hand can be incredibly helpful. The goal is to create distance from the work you’ve poured so much effort into. You want to make it feel unfamiliar (almost as if someone else wrote it) so you can critique it with fresh eyes and make meaningful improvements.

When I was office based, I printed out many documents because I found hard copies easier to edit. While I miss that convenience, I know the environment is better off for it.

# 3. Read aloud

>If you force yourself to read your writing aloud, you will hear things you missed on the silent page - repetitions, clumsy phrases, clichés and a general lack of rhythm. - *William Zinsser*

*Austin* *Kleon* recounts, *Something I learned when I did an audiobook for the first time. Everyone should do the audiobook before they put the book out because when you have to read the text, you realise how bad it is. So one of the hacks I do is put on headphones and pull up the manuscript and read it like I would read it to an audiobook.*

In a similar vein, I read my blog post aloud and make amendments if the text does not flow. Then I record myself.

"I'm not the best writer, and this is super sappy... you've been warned. I'm constantly worried about my whole life crashing... mostly due to not having the money to pay for things or losing someone special to me... but right now, in this very moment... I'm having one of those times... where you're in that moment for just a second longer... grateful for your life.... grateful for the life you built... and proud of every damn decision you've ever made to get HERE.... in your room, that you share with no one else... your own little oasis, that blocks you from that crazy outside place. I'm grateful to live in the city, have a job that pays me what I deserve, and the opportunity to make more if I really tried.. grateful for that little car outside that gets me to work and and back each day.. for the angels in heaven that make sure i do just that... listening to the rain and watching  my favorite comfort show for the millionth time... grateful for the family I was born in, the incredible friends that always have my back, and the men that make my heart flutter. Grateful that through all of the terrible decisions I make on the daily and have made in the past, it got me to where I am today. I have never been so truly happy and incredibly anxiety ridden in my entire life, and I love it. So if you're reading this and your wondering what show I'm watching.. or what city i live in... just know... that life is always worth living, and if you feel any differently about that, do ur best each and every day to get where you want to be... because if you ever get there and have the chance to be this lucky, thank the ones who sacrificed for you to be here. I think about my abuelo and the trauma he must of endured at a young age, despite ALL OF THAT he managed to take care of my grandmother and all their babies, and build a strong unit, a solid family. Who are always there for each other, never fight, always laugh and take care of each other... I thank the universe and God or whatever good thing i did in my last life...for my grandparents...and my parents... who immigrated to this country...to provide a ""better"" life for me.... because they did everything in their power to make sure that their future generations life was better than their own... I'm grateful for each and every human in this world who has love for me.... because in one way or another... they have made an impact on my life... and made me the sweet, caring, stubborn son of a bitch that u see before you. I end this by saying... cheers... from one scared...lost... 30 something soul... Thank you for reading my nonsense, and i hope that you feel this way often in your own lifetime. ",excited,Happy

Montrealers, I absolutely love, love, and love your city! It is so beautiful and everyone welcomed us with open arms. Everyone was so friendly and happy. It was freezing cold, seriously it felt like -30 but it didn’t bother us. I absolutely love everyone speaking French and everything from the signs to stores being French!

"Accidentally discovered a peaceful spot to have office lunch At office, I'm usually a silent guy that does his job, interacts well with his team, grabs free snack and goes home. I'm neither the life of the office vibe nor the killer. For lunch, I usually have some compact wraps or bowls at my desk. The other day I craved something new and ordered this grilled chicken plate. While it was delicious this was something I couldn't have at my desk as I usually do. So I walked around and discovered this amazingly nice spot to have a peaceful lunch.

Told me to ask again if I needed more help, which I did again when I went up 5 lbs for my last set. He was super nice, didn’t have his hands on the bar the whole time (so I felt like I was still doing the work), and it just made me happy.

"I hit 100k monthly listeners on Spotify as a self-taught musician and fully independent artist!! Most people thought I was delusional when I first started...and I honestly oubted myself many times too..but I'm super glad I never gave up! 2.5 years ago I had decided I didn't want to work a 9-5 for the rest of my life. So I knew I had to do something about it. I always had tons of musical ideas running through my head and could already play piano so I decided I would try to give the music thing a shot...and hopefully one day be able to make a full time income from it. 

Almost everyone thought I was delusional, and it kind of hurt quite a bit...And I know realistically it kind of is. Because statistically speaking most musicians never see money from their art. But I had to at least try and give it my best...And I'm so glad I never gave up!!! I now make quite a decent part time income from my music now. And getting closer than ever to one day being able to support myself full time doing something I love and :')

Never give up if you truly want something~

"I've taken care of myself for 99 days in a row Holy shit almost 100 days of me taking care of myself!! From going to not taking care of myself at all to now taking a ton of care of myself and keeping my room clean, getting rid of my acne, brushing my teeth everyday, keeping myself clean. I feel so good. Yeah, I'm in a depressive episode now, but it's not as bad as it was before when I didn't have Finch. It's a lot better now. I hope one day it'll help with Mt anxiety and depression, but for now I'm celebrating one thing at a time!!

"My life is looking up, and I just had one of the best birthdays ever. Happy isn't a strong enough word. I had work today, so my love made me a beautiful frittata for breakfast. On my lunch, she and her son brought fried chicken sandwiches from my favorite food truck. We had a nice lunch together. 
After lunch I was informed that I have been promoted and will be receiving a raise. (I haven't been with this place long, and this is what I was hoping for.) Upon arriving home i find a German chocolate cake, two birthday cards and wrapped presents (from her son, who remembered my favorite chocolates and wrote me a sweet card.)
All that followed by a nice soak in the hot tub and a footrub.
 Happy doesn't really cut it. 
Enjoy what you have. I sure as hell plan too. ",excited,Happy

"I am so happy and content with how my life is going! Spreading Joy & Love to all! I’ve struggled with my mental health most of my life due to a very rough upbringing and various bad choices Ive made throughout my life.

But for the first time in ever? I just feel so happy and content with every single thing in my life.

- I have a lovely and supportive friend group.
- My physical and mental health is the best it has ever been.
- I’ve landed my dream job and have been enjoying every second of it for more than a month.
- My living/home situation is great with sharing a lovely flat in my dream city with friends.
- And one more very silly reason which kinda made me write this - I can enjoy weed again!

I used to really enjoy smoking for relaxation (never have abused it), until the feelings I got from THC pulled a full 180 and instead of relaxing I would just get horrible anxiety.

This lasted for almost 4 years and each year I would give it 1 chance to see if I still hate it - I did every time. 

Except now - did some lovely peach candy edibles and it just made me so happy and reflective on how good things are.

Spreading joy and love to you all!

"I love doing obnoxious things to make the people around me smile! I woke up yesterday and I was in a really good mood. When it was time to go get my boyfriend from work, I decided I was going to try and make him laugh. So I found a radio station that had classical music playing and when he came out, I cranked the volume all the way up. He got in the car and every time he tried to speak to me, I'd hold my hand up and say ""Wait a minute, this ones a banger.""

After the music stopped, I had to pull over because we were both laughing so hard. I wish all days were filled with that much joy and happiness <3

Good day everyone!",excited,Happy

"I’m finally feeling appreciate at work, there is hope! After over a year and half at my job, I finally have the opportunity to get promoted. I live in Pa, but have been given the chance for a major promotion and to move to a new state. I’ll be going from a normal inventory person to either a manager at a new store or even an assistant general manager (2nd highest position). I’ve been working my ass off for months and my general manager wants me to go with him to a new state to lead others. It might not seem like much, but it’s something I’ve been working for, for months. Plus, I can start my life over with my partner. I’m beyond scared of this, but I’m way more excited. It gives me hope that life has more to offer than what I’ve been going through. It teaches me to work through the hard parts, and keep looking up!

UPDATE: Turns out I most likely won’t be able to move away and get the promotion I’ve wanted. The timeframe is too short and I just can’t afford it. I feel so heartbroken over this. I’m over working myself to prove I deserve this, but that doesn’t even matter. It feels like nothing matters. I don’t want to start over at a new job, but I can’t stay here if I don’t have a future. Hopefully I get better news, but right now I just feel depressed and empty. ",excited,Happy
"Reminder I wrote to myself to always keep in mind I am in control of my own happiness. At this point you need to remember, talking, vocalizing your fears, wants, needs, feelings, heartaches, begging, and pleading, has not helped. 
It is out of your hands. 
You cannot change him or his feelings towards you. His outlook on life. 
You have been grieving the future you thought you’d have together. 
Hope springs eternal, you restart the clock. The clock will not wait for you. You only have one life. But you have so much love to give. 
You need to start with loving yourself. Wholly. You deserve true love. Respect. Intimacy. Reciprocation. A partner. 
Until then, you must be a partner to yourself. You, and only you. Give yourself grace. Focus on your goals and your needs. 
In the beginning, you’ll just need to make it through each day. 
You know you can do this. It just hurts so badly because you love him so much, you thought he was the one, you thought you’d found your best friend, your partner in life, your soulmate, your family. You thought you’d celebrate your bonds. You thought you’d start a family of your own. This does not make you stupid or weak. This means you had hope when none could be seen, you saw light in the darkness, you saw a kindred spirit. It means you have love to give, you see the good in people. You want a  better life, a better world. You can still be a part of these things. You must let go of the frustration, the what-ifs, the whys. He will not answer you. You may never receive closure. But you must keep living. Not surviving, not scraping by, not dragging around a husk of who you used to be. You must live. For you.",excited,Happy

"Got accepted into university ….. at almost 50. 😅 My life has taken so many twists and turns. But recently I’ve been seeing my daughter applying and getting accepted into different universities. So I decided to apply for my degree that I almost finished once. 

Let me go back. I was working what felt like a dead-end job for my dad. My daughter was born and I couldn’t see myself doing what I was doing with her in my life. With help from my wife I applied to university in my early 30s. Almost towards the end of my dual degree in computer engineering and electrical engineering. I was offered an internship with Intel in Oregon. A one year internship turned into seven wonderful years. Before my father offered to actually pay me to work for him. lol. So came back to work for him and eventually myself. 

Now I regret not finishing those degrees. And seeing my daughter apply for university got me thinking that it’s not too late to finish what I started.

I might get confused as the professor on the first day, but I’m so excited. So happy to have applied and gotten accepted again.

I’m hoping in a year I’ll post about my graduation. 🤞🏽",excited,Happy
"I know it’s not a lot, but Im happy that i Modded a game without help. I know it’s not much, but man, I’m really proud of myself for modding a game—especially because I know almost nothing about computers. Like, if you asked me to install Word on your PC, I wouldn’t know how to do it. If you asked me to download Firefox, I’d probably just reset the whole thing.

I’ve always loved playing on consoles, and when it comes to PC gaming, I usually ask my cousin for help. But he tends to be really mean about it, so I decided to give it a shot on my own. It took quite some time, but I did it, and I’m very proud of myself—which is something I haven’t felt or said in a long time.

You’d think that someone who works at a GPS company would know about this stuff, but nope, haha. Still, this has inspired me to maybe learn more about computers—and hopefully not blow mine up in the process, haha.

This is my first post on Reddit ever, and also not a native speaker, so I apologize if I made a mistake.",excited,Happy

"It took some time but I found my true happiness... I was 47 when I met a colleague who would later become a friend and within 5 years my best friend, partner, and as of just two months ago, my wife. I was not an unhappy person by any means but it's been through her friendship and partnership that I've found my true self and realized real inner happiness. 

My appreciation for the impact our relationship has had on the way I see myself, my business, my children, my parents, and interact with countless others is something I'll always be proud of.

I wasn't missing anything without her. But I'm so much better with her in my life.

It's a wonderful adventure of self discovery and partnership. And I try every day not to fuck it up.",excited,Happy

I got homemade banana bread in the oven. House smells delicious

"I am very happy after my date playfully manhandled me Idk if this is even the right sub, but I need to say this to someone that's not family or friends.

I am 21 and new to dating. I've been exploring the apps and things have mostly been casual with all my encounters and I am okay with that. Met with a match for the second time and we're chilling and having some wine and watching a movie wtv wtv. We're cuddling and he puts me in a wresling neck lock (playfully of course) and we're talking about stuff and idk somehow we're at one point standing and he just lifts me by the waist and sits me on his shoulder. I am 5'4"" and 135 pounds and i know that sounds like good stats but ive always been a bit flabby kinda curvy ig? This just made me feel very very cutesy and dainty its the most I'd laughed in a while. He's a wrestling trainer and wrestler himself and it just shocks me how strong boys can be. There were also a couple times he just scooped me up and tossed me on the bed and I realized how happy getting manhandled can make me. I want to tell him this but idk I dont want to seem soo overtly about it. I do remember genuinely complimenting him a lot throughout the night about how strong he is. And yeah I am very happy after last night.",excited,Happy

"A tad silly, but I got my own sewing machine, the exact same as my moms. Technically I got this in November, but I was sick for two weeks and had never opened it, until now.

My mom used to sew 95% of the clothes I owned and I had even began sewing my own clothes with her machine. I looked online for the brand, just to see when it was made when I found it for an AMAZING price. About 120, with 50 dollar shipping, so 170 in total!!!

My mom and the old sewing machine are still around so it seems a bit silly to get so happy over this but I am, lol.

"Life Center (Livingston, NJ) field trip experience. For the first field trip my Sophomore HS year special education class had was for this place called Life Center, where it is an indoor simulator for autistic children to explore what life is like outside of school. I have ADHD. There is a ShopRite, with snacks, a book store, a mini theater, grooming pet center and more. I first decided to ride a bike around this paper course with 2 crossing guard surrounding the little path around the indoor town. If was sort of fun. I then got a doctor’s appointment at a place with 4 doctors checking my heart rate and if it was a good boy or not. I should also tell that my female school aid was around me all the time. A little boy came up to me and told me to move while I was in the book store, it was kind of whatever, I laughed. I saw iced coffee there and did not drink it because it would keep me up, big boys need to sleep. I saw my female cerebral palsy friend come over to me and I hugged her, while we headed into the mini theater with popcorn along with some of the younger kids in our class. They played Discovery Kids, haha. When we were done, I headed over to the dog grooming section, the dogs there were so cute. There was this Siberian Husky that came up to me and started licking my tummy and I giggled. I went to go pet the Golden Retriever at the back, but it but me on instinct, it kind of hurt but I was okay. After all the fun, we finally went back to the school. We said our goodbyes and thank you’s and we left to go to the school.

It was very, fun and I recommend going there if you like to and you are in New Jersey. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did.",excited,Happy

"My mom met my bestfriend for the first time. I'm a highschool student & yesterday, I attended an Academic Achievements award ceremony I was invited to with my mom & my bestfriend (who I snuck in as my sister).

I had a pretty long, work day after which I was to directly attend the ceremony & I was so tired & hungry so, I asked my bestfriend to bring chewing gum for me. She showed up with pasta & a sandwich her mom had made along with a breath spray too. I had initially asked for a chewing gum mainly because I kind of have this weird phobia of my breath being unpleasant if I haven't brushed my teeth in a couple of hours, she doesn't know this. The fact that she showed up with all 3 of these things truly is the most thoughtful thing a friend has ever done for me. 

At the ceremony, they separated the students & their families so, my mum & bestfriend sat together & planned to chant my name when I would appear on stage to collect my award.
When I was in line to go on stage, they both kept filming me with the widest smile on their face: it was like the 'proud mom meme' but I couldn't tell who the actual proud mom was. Even in the car ride there, we three kept laughing the entire time.

After the ceremony, we ate these amazing fries together while I told my mom some crazy friendship drama another one of my friends at school was going through. We then headed for dinner & we were pretty much laughing the entire time. 

I know this all might not sound all that special like the other stories on here but I still wanted to share it. This was one of those evenings of my life that I forever want to remember. It happened yesterday so it is all fresh in my memory but the main reason I'm posting this is because I want this to stay fresh in my memory always, I never want to forget this day. Even typing this right now kind of makes me tear right up but I truly hope everyone gets moments like this in their life where they feel so loved. 

I think if you look closely, love truly is all around. Hint: it's in the fries you eat with your mum & your bestfriend.",excited,Happy
"I was so nervous for my boyfriend to come home to the mess I made today… I was so nervous for my boyfriend to come home to the mess I made today… 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 7 months, and we live together in a beautiful house full of unique art and trinkets. I stopped working a few months ago, as I was losing more money on gas going to work than I was making, and I was stressed and never had the time or energy to do the art projects I love. He makes decent money to support the two of us and his house is paid off, so he offered to support me while I wait for school to start and figure out the next step. 

I usually keep the house clean and organized while he’s at work, since I get bored easily and love having an organized and appealing house to spend my time in, and when he gets home we can spend time together instead of worrying about the state of the house. 

Today, however, I went full manic art project mode. The porch had epoxy resin projects everywhere, the living room had paints and canvases and random pieces of wood and gold foil leaf pieces and glitter scattered about. In my head I planned on finishing my projects and cleaning up by the time he came home, but I got lost in the creations, and before I knew it, he walked through the front door. 

I’ve been in some pretty rough relationships in the past, where I modify my life and actions to fit their happiness, and constantly worry about pleasing them instead of spending my time fulfilling my own needs. Because of this, I had a mini heart attack, thinking he was going to yell or act annoyed or disappointed in me for spending all day goofing off instead of cleaning or being productive. 

Instead, he grabbed me and hugged me and said “This is the most beautiful messy scene I could have ever walked into.” I asked him what he meant by that, not believing he wasn’t upset at first. He then explained that the whole point of him offering to take care of things if I decided to take advantage of our financial situation and quit my job was because he knew I have so much creative passion, but no time or energy to pursue any of it. He told me that seeing me do things that make me fulfilled creatively is worth any amount of mess that can always be cleaned up. 

It’s not a huge deal, or big amazing story, but man…. I’m not used to having someone who genuinely cares about my ambitions and not just what I contribute financially or to the household. I’ve never had a relationship where my partner actually cares that I contribute to my own free spirit as well. 

I’m just really fucking happy. ",excited,Happy
"I’m finally free from my father, I turned 18 today! Today I turned 18. A huge birthday and it’s been one hell or a ride my whole life. Since I’m now legally an adult, I can finally cut off contact with my father. My inner child is free knowing she won’t have to deal with the pain and manipulation he put on me. I’m celebrating my step towards adulthood and severely in my mind, my freedom. I’m not obligated to do calls all the time and put on my happy face knowing what he’s done to my mom and my family for literally my whole life. This weight is off my chest and I just wanted to type it out and share, that no matter how hard it may seem to deal with an abusive parent, you can make it out. And life WILL be better. It’s already changed for me so much and I’m so happy. My mom is my ride or die and I’m so grateful for her help for everything I’ve been through. :,)",excited,Happy
"When I was in the plane after leaving Lanzarote, everythings felt right and was one of my happiest moments in my life Yesterday I was thinking about one of my happiest moments. I'm just 19 years old and always wanted to explore the world. I have Asperger syndrome and I become one of the best pianists in my country, I was selected to participate in concerts in Europe.

Long story short, my happiest moment was when I was leaving Lanzarote, an isle from the Canary Islands, I was in the plane, seeing how Lanzarote becomes more and more tiny in my window and hearing music from a game called Dredge. The game it's from exploring the ocean and have a very sentimental and magic music.

So, I was leaving the Isle and seeing in my window with a little bit of nostalgia, with the food from the plane in my table and my seat near to the window and without any person near to me (I'm very shy). And for a little bit, everything had sense. That's the only travel I ever had in my life, I quit piano and now I'm learning physics and mathematics, it's another thing that I really like, but I would never forget those days, and specifically that last day in Lanzarote. Thank you for reading my post.",excited,Happy

"Quit drinking - reconnected with old crush 2024 was by far the hardest year of my life.  I broke up with my ex of 10 years.  Used alcohol and pills to self medicate.

I quit pills 2 weeks ago.  Last Friday I had my last beer.  I feel amazing and it's only been a few days.    
  
Yesterday re-connected with an old crush who is also sober.  We hadn't talked in years.  I was always super shy...we fooled around (20 years ago) a little but never took it to the next level.  I was super nervous but I didn't want to get stuck in the friend zone so I shot my shot.  I'm driving down to see her this weekend and go on a date.  She actually said she was gonna ask me out if I didn't have the courage to do it...she's sick of guys treating her poorly and she wants to give it a shot with a good guy.  

I feel so blessed and lucky.

Last week this time I was super depressed.  Now I feel like I'm floating on cloud 9.

"My best friend finally contacted me again Me and her have done everything together the last year, sharing so many incredible memories. We had a huge fight at the end of December and she said she needed space away from me. Three weeks of zero contact let me rethink a lot... but also got me extremely depressed because I didn't know if she'd be in my life anymore.

Three weeks later, she texted me again! We saw each other at a group hangout and she was being cool! And now she's texting me a bit more. Things are very slowly returning to normal and I'm happy she's back in my life :)",excited,Happy

"My best friend's Hen Party (bachelorette) - feeling seen and loved Hi! I put bachelorette in the title as I gather a lot of users are not from the UK where we call it a 'hen party'.

Anyway my best friend is engaged to be married this summer and I am looking forward to it immensely. I love her deeply and really like the person she's engaged to.

I messaged her to ask if she'd like me to arrange her hen party and she replied to say thank you but she just saw her sisters on the weekend and they have already started making a plan, so it's all in hand. Totally fine with me :)

What really made me happy is that the friend messaged to say an outline of what they're thinking for the event - a night or two away. Knowing that I have mobility issues (legally disabled) she suggested that some of it might not be suitable for me (hiking, wild swimming, etc) and so gave me the option of whether Id like to be put in the whatsapp group when they set it up. This means the world to me - to be seen and recognised and given choices. People very often overlook my problems and it leaves me in an awkward spot of having to explain that actually...I can't do XYZ and then have to make excuses about not coming, etc. She's just totally removed that as an issue and I am deeply relieved.

I have said that we can plan a little something just the two of us. Like a night at a nice hotel, or a fancy meal out, etc.

Anyway - this made me so happy - so I'm sharing!",excited,Happy

me and some of my friends are throwing a party, and we planned to sleep over at the place, tonight this (amazing) friend of mine told us she can't sleepover and has to leave early because her mom doesn't allow her (she is a really good and responsible girl) and that they fought about this, so I texted her because I tought she may need some comfort. we talked for a little while, I told her I'm sorry, that it's not her fault and that I love her. In the end she texted me ""I love you a lot, you really are a wonderful person"" and I was just like this 🥹🥹 cause she is such a good caring and sweet girl and im so sad that her parents are strict. 

I also have a ""friend crush"" on her, meaning I really wanna be her friend (I mean, I already am her friend, buy I whish to be CLOSE with her) and this just melted my heart.

"What small cozy rituals do you do for yourself just because they make you happy? Hey everyone!!

I’ve been thinking a lot about how we show kindness to ourselves in everyday boring life - not the big, extravagant gestures, but the small, consistent things we do just because they make us happy. For example, I buy myself flowers every Friday. I don’t tell myself I don’t need them or that they’re unnecessary. I just want them. Even when I don't have the extra money. They brighten my space and when they wilt after a few days, I throw them out and get new ones. It’s feels luxurious and grounding to me. 🤷‍♀️ Do you have any small rituals or indulgences like this? Like, idk, wearing your perfume to bed?",excited,Happy

"To the One Who Changed My Life: A Letter to My Reddit Friend  Six months ago, on the unpredictable side of the internet, I met someone who would change my life in ways I never could have imagine. Through the simple exchange of words on Reddit, i found someone who I will forever be grateful for. 

He has this weird side that I can’t help but adore. His taste in music is nothing I’ve ever encountered, sometimes so unique and unexpected that it makes me laugh, but it’s also part of what makes him, him. It’s a reflection of his quirky personality, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. 

His smile, oh his smile, is one of the most beautiful things and it always warms my heart. He’s a picky eater, but there’s something endearing about it. He knows exactly what he likes, and I can’t help but find that charming. 

And then there’s his humour, his ability to make me laugh and blush everyday makes me feel so happy.  He’s also a beautiful writer. He does it so effortlessly and every word is chosen with such care that it feels like it was meant just for me. His way of writing is often something that lingers in my mind. 

But beyond all that, he has this incredible ability to care for me and consistently show me what true love feels like. In a world that often feels lonely, he has shown me warmth, kindness, and a beautiful presence that has comforted me when I felt I was falling apart.

To my beautiful friend,  If I could give you one gift, it would be the chance to see yourself through my eyes. You’d see how incredible you are, how your kindness, humor, and understanding make the world a brighter place. You’ve brought so much light and comfort into my life, and I hope you know how much you’re appreciated.

I’m so lucky to have met you. Thank you for being exactly who you are. My sweet boy, i love you forever and always

"First time I write down the words ""I'm happy"" Started to write down my thoughts in 2018. Was depressed very often, had some suicidal thoughts but rarely. Very pessimistic about life in general. 

Back then I wasn't happy but I was doing a lot of things. Started manual labor on a whim because I didn't find fullfilment in my studies. The job was hard, especially because I was not a manual persone at all. Boss was kindda nice outside of work but very demanding. I was depressed to go to work but still found good things here and there. Found out I was bisexual and on the aromantic spectrum wich both explained a lot of things from my past experiences. So life was hard, but it was changing.  So I started to put things on paper to sort them out.



Moved a lot, had a burnout in 2019 and a big alcool problem. Within the 3 last years I lost contact with almost all of my friends. Loneliness, alcool and burnout left me completely emptied. Had 1 complete month with the desire to end my life every fucking morning. Still wanted to end it all during the rest of the year but at least it wasn't every morning.



Came back in my home country right before COVID crisis. Worked 3 months, no right to any subsiddies or money during the crisis. Had to burn everything I had during the crisis to not go back to mom and dad. Good thing was that since everybody had times I took contact with my old friends and we played TTRPG online like in the good old days. Never lost contact with them since, turned out we're all somewhere on the LGBT spectrum one way or another. Loneliness was (mostly) gone, money was (completely) gone.

Started making money again, nothing special for 5 years. Don't like the work but you gotta do what you gotta do. Got better, started taking care of what I eat and worked out a bit. No sexual life at all, no social life except online with my old friends. After these very boring but also appeased years, I realize I prefer my friends over my family. I decide to go to a town where all my friends are.



It's been a year now, my old friends are by far my closest relationships I ever had. Joined LGBT and BDSM groups, I met new people and made some good acquaintances. Social life is better it ever was.  
  
I'm now at peace with my sexuality and the fact I am aromantic. I live alone but I have a very good sexlife. Hated hugs because I felt I had to do them when I was in relationships. Now I love them because it's just a mark of affection without romantic implication. Started seeing some of my close friends as sexfriends and it's going very well without any ambiguity. I do kinky things, vanilla things, I just take in the affection and the skinship after more than half a decade with almost none of it.

This morning I wrote down a bit on my journal I started in 2018. I don't write very often, depends on the timeframe but I took a look on the different entries. It's the first time ever I wrote that I am happy and that I feel good. I feel like, I just manage to turn a significant page of my life. ",excited,Happy

"(M30) Actually felt like I made my mom proud for the first time During Christmas I was visiting family for a few days. I was there with quite a few people including my mom, two older sisters, etc. I was having some conversation with one of my sisters about how my current job is really good and I'm finally in a good place. I'm in the best position I've ever been in; financially, mentally, physically. I never imagined I'd find something that could do this for me. During the conversation I hinted at how much I earned for the year and my sister seemed really surprised and happy for me. I could tell from her reaction she didn't expect me to be making as much as I did. She commented on how she didn't make that much until much further in her career. My mom overheard us talking and gave about the same reaction as my sister. 

Fast forward to the day I'm leaving to go back home and my mom told me she was proud of me. She was trying not to cry while telling me a few more times. It really hit me because I could tell how serious she was. I've never in my life felt like I could say I've ever made my mom proud until this moment. I've dealt with depression for the majority of my life and never imagined I'd live this long or even contemplate the possibility of retirement one day. I made it one day at a time practically my whole life and it was miserable. I'm so fortunate to finally have stability and I hope that I can continue to make my family proud.",excited,Happy
"A girl (23) in my friend group admitted that she has a crush on me (25M)! And for years, I kinda sensed that she had some interest towards me given how she acted around me. But I didn't think she was full-blown crushing on me.

Last night, I, my twin brother, my ex-girlfriend, her brother, and the girl were smoking weed on the couch watching YouTube videos. She was sitting on my left, and as I was feeling so cozy, we started snuggling up, just resting our heads together at first. Then I started resting my head on her shoulder. After some time, I put my left arm fully around her while my right hand was placed on her right shoulder. As more time went on, I had my arms around her as if I was hugging her. I could feel her moving her arm to touch mine in an affectionate manner. Before you know it, we're now holding hands! Later on, I was massaging her hair, which she enjoyed. Towards the end, we were full-on cuddling together. Neither one of us wanted to let go.

The very next day, she texted me directly about how we held hands and cuddled. She said she was sad that it ended. I told her I enjoyed it, too. She then confessed that she had a crush on me for years and would have asked me to be her prom date had it not been canceled due to COVID.

I told her that I like her, too. And now we're going on a date next week!

tl;dr: I cuddled up with a girl in my friend group and later held hands with her. The very next day, she confessed that she had a crush on me, and we're going on a date next week!",excited,Happy

"moved out for the 1st time. decorated my bedroom for the 1st time. when i lived with parents i was never allowed to have anything on my bedroom wall, no posters, no drawing, no photos. must keep empty. they were extremely controlling and abusive in many ways. one of the most insidious was financially abusing me. made me pay 60-80% of my salary as “food and board”. i scarped by for years to save enough to move out. i’m slowly learning i can decorate my apartment. i can choose my own bedsheets. i can hang a cool carpet of a bear playing guitar if i wanted to. wow. for reference i rented a 2 bedroom in a okey part of town with only 40% of my salary. it’s why i was “mooching” off my parents. 


sorry i don’t have much stuff. i hope to fill my room with things i love slowly 💜",excited,Happy

He told me he loved me last night, and I felt every word he said and his look gave it all away. I’ve never met someone who is willing to be vulnerable, and who has never understood me like he has. We constantly have deep conversations that last for hours and we’ve moved slow in the right ways and fast in the right ways. I think I’m going to marry this man one day. I want to be with him until the day I die. So many weird things keep happening that don’t seem like coincidence. Everything feels right, and like it’s meant to be. I believe after all the years of torment in my life, I have finally found my home and my true happiness. I just wanted to share that I’m the happiest I’ve been in a long long time.

"New relationship but I've not been this happy in nearly 10 years I have had some really bad luck with partners over the last 10 years or so. Along with long term health issues that past relationships didnt really support me with. My ex-wife and I divorced after she cheated on me. I had a couple of dating relationships since then but nothing has made me as happy as the girl I've been seeing for the last 2 months. 

She's only 2 years younger than me so we both have similar interests in our childhood (watched the same shows growing up in the 90s for example). 
We have the same political views and opinions.
We both don't want children.
She is very focused on her work, so she hasn't dated in a long time. She loves her job and it seems quite rewarding for her despite how difficult it is. She's extremely intelligent. I could sit and listen to her talk about anything at all.
She takes care of herself, both physically and mentally. She keeps herself fit at the gym but also makes sure she takes a Friday evening to relax in her bath and de-stress.
She speaks her mind about what she likes and dislikes, it's very refreshing after my past relationships. We can be very open with each other. 
Not to mention she's incredibly pretty. Gorgeous grey/blue eyes and brown/blonde hair shes growing out. I can lose myself looking at her like some kind of teenager on a first date. Insane body from her gym work too. Stong legs and arms, amazing ass, super smooth skin. I am way out of my league. 
I love just cuddling with her and listening to her get passionate about films and actors as we are watching TV. Just being near her and next to her makes my heart pound. She got into my car the other day with a comfy jumper and hair in a messy ponytail and she looked so perfect I couldn't process it and I felt my chest tighten with some sort of anxiety/happiness. 

I know it sounds stupid and lovey dovey. But I've not been this happy with someone. I think maybe ever. I can't even remember feeling like this when I met my ex wife. 
I love her. I haven't said it to her because I know it's too soon but I know I do. I think I knew it on our second date, and every day/evening/date we spend together, I know it more and more. I have to keep it under wraps a little as I don't want to scare her by being too crazy. But sometime soon it's just going to get blurted out without me thinking. ",excited,Happy

"I disabled instagram notifications. I’m so much happier now. For some context I got addicted to instagram like 3 months ago and I’ve been on a mental downward spiral eversince. 

I loved this girl that I knew irl. We chatted on instagram after she moved away to boardingschool. It was very good at first but then the delay in texting back on her end just got longer and longer. It hurt me so much that I cried almost every night. I would keep on waiting for a notification and hope that she responded to me or texted me. Each time I got a notification I would get so excited only for it to not be her responding and that made me cry even more. 

It took me 3 months to realise that I needed to do something about my mental health. So one day I decided that enough is enough and I completely disabled every notifications for instagram and started focusing on myself and my image. 

Its been amazing so far. Ive improved so much compared to 3 moths ago in so many diffrent aspects of my life. (I still do cry about her because she has an amazing personality and a brilliant mind but its more like once every 7-9 days). 

I just wanted to share my story here. Hope you can relate to it in some way or another! ",excited,Happy
" I Realized I Only Get Excited About Things, Not Truly Happy A few days ago, I had a big realization. I noticed that I only get *excited* about certain things—like a new project, a quick freelance gig, or something I’ve been waiting for—but deep down, I’m not really *happy*. It’s like my life is running on moments of adrenaline, but the overall vibe is... dull.

For the past two years, I’ve been working from home almost exclusively, doing some freelancing on the side. That means I spend most of my days indoors and most of my nights awake. Seeing the outside world has become rare, and the routine is starting to suffocate me.

So, I’ve decided to make some big changes:

1. **I’m buying a bike** to go on tours and explore. I miss the feeling of fresh air, open roads, and just being *out there*.
2. I’m switching to a **hybrid work setup**, where I’ll spend some days working from an office. I think being around people and breaking the monotony of home life will help.

I’m sharing this because I feel like a lot of us have been stuck in similar cycles since the pandemic and remote work became the norm. If you’ve been through something like this, how did you break out of it?",excited,Happy
"After 10 years, got closure and a good friend back It feels so good to have that weight lifted. I had a best friend, and as it goes sometimes, we thought it would be a good idea to be more than friends. It was an exciting whirlwind after high school that ended abruptly one day...I was confused and hurt. We haven't really talked in 10 years or so. 10 years later, we both have families, and my wife and her are great friends, I'm friends with her husband, and we've been hanging out, though her and I just kind of mutually exist without really talking very much. 

Anyway, the other night we had a really great conversation, talked over things for the first time in 10 years, and it felt like a weight lifted. Simply put: we were always just better friends than anything else. It feels like the old, pre-craziness times again, and I couldn't be happier to have gained a friend back that I really missed. If it makes sense, I really didn't miss the relationship, I missed the friendship without the complications. Now that's back and I'm ecstatic.",excited,Happy
"Reflecting on a Transformative Year: Teaching, Personal Growth and Finding Myself  I’ve written a reflective post of my year that I was going to post but I don’t know how well it will go with people I know, so instead I’d like to share it here… 

This year has been nothing short of transformative. After years of hard work, late nights, and moments of doubt, I finally completed my degree in teaching—a goal that once felt so far out of reach. For a long time, it was a dream others doubted I could achieve, but here I am, standing on the other side of that accomplishment with pride and gratitude.

Finishing my degree wasn’t just about earning a qualification—it was about proving to myself that perseverance and dedication can turn even the most daunting goals into reality.

But the journey didn’t stop there. This year also marked the start of my career as a teacher. My first year in the classroom has been full of ups and downs, surprises, and so much growth. Teaching has challenged me in ways I never imagined but has also been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Helping young minds grow, seeing their lightbulb moments, and navigating the complexities of this role has reinforced why I chose this path.

On top of that, I took a leap of faith and moved far away to live in a remote area. My earlier experiences taught me the grounding and healing power of new environments, and I knew this move was exactly what I needed.

Living here has been a roller coaster of a time—eye-opening, challenging, and deeply rewarding. To experience the serenity and vastness of the landscape daily has been exactly what my heart and mind needed to reset and recharge. The quiet moments and connection to nature have reminded me what it means to truly live. It’s a slower, more intentional way of being, and it has given me a clarity I didn’t know I was missing.

Becoming My True Self
This year has also deepened my journey of becoming my most authentic self. Transitioning has been a process of discovering, embracing, and becoming the person I’ve always known myself to be. With each passing year, the changes I’ve experienced—physically, emotionally, and mentally—have brought me closer to alignment with my true self.

It hasn’t always been an easy journey, but the rewards have been transformative. I’ve grown in confidence, self-acceptance, and pride in who I am. Living authentically is not just about external changes; it’s about stepping into life as the person I’ve always been, and I can honestly say I’ve never felt more at home in myself.

The Power of Connection
One of the most meaningful parts of this year has been the connections I’ve built with the people around me. Working alongside others, learning from diverse perspectives, and immersing myself in a rich culture of understanding have strengthened me in ways I didn’t expect. These experiences have helped me develop a deeper sense of belonging and purpose in my work and personal life.

Finding common ground with others, sharing knowledge, and collaborating on meaningful goals have reminded me of the power of community, even in the most unfamiliar places. These relationships have been a source of inspiration and growth, showing me that connection is at the heart of resilience and fulfillment.

This year wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible people in my life. To everyone who has supported me, encouraged me, and believed in me—thank you. Your kindness and words of affirmation have kept me going when things felt overwhelming.

A special acknowledgment goes to someone very dear to me who is no longer here. Their unwavering belief in me and their endless support are the reasons I’ve been able to accomplish all of this. I know their spirit has been with me every step of the way, and I truly wouldn’t be where I am without the love and encouragement they gave me.

And, as if this year wasn’t full enough, I also added a new dog to my little fur family. Their companionship has been a constant source of joy, humor, and love, making my days brighter and my life richer.

Looking back, this year has been about embracing change, leaning into challenges, and celebrating milestones that once felt impossible. Completing my degree, starting my teaching career, and building a life that feels authentically mine are things I’m immensely proud of.

As I welcome the new year, I carry with me the lessons of resilience, self-trust, and gratitude for how far I’ve come. Here’s to another year of growth, connection, and new adventures.

Happy New Year, everyone—may it be kind, bold, and full of possibility.

"I GOT STRAIGHT As THIS SEMESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER!!! So, I’m someone who has always done fairly well academically. In high school, I maintained a B+/A- average with a ton of AP and honors classes. However, what prevented me from achieving higher grades (that I knew I could achieve) was not having the proper accommodations I needed until my senior year of high school and college subsequently. 

The closest I had gotten to having straight As (before this semester) was my first semester of senior year of high school. I got 3 -As, 1 B+, and the rest of the grades were As. While this is really good, one of my goals for college was to have at least one semester where I had straight As (no -As, just As).

After a lot of work, having the proper accommodations I need, and dealing with a lot personally this semester, I opened my unofficial transcript this evening. Not only did I get straight As, but my GPA went up to a 3.85! 

I’m so freaking happy and proud of myself. I hope next semester’s grades are good like this!!!!

"I finally managed to read more than one free-reading book this year, in more than fifteen years! I’ve actively avoided free reading for fifteen years.

"2024 was the absolute best year of my life (so far) At 00:01 on the first of January a friend said: let this year be free of suffering.

[26F]
It's the year I was more happy than unhappy and the ratio is around 75% to 25%.

A general feeling of love and being loved, of being healthy and young. 

Wrote, illustrated and published a little fictional book based on 3 years of schizophrenia. I am now mostly healed and in a calm and enjoyable state of maybe still a bit between realities but am not afraid of it. Packed the book with paradoxes and hopefully transmitted a feeling of a mind a bit too open. 

Worked in different fields: as a 3D artist & as a journalist in my third! language only to realize I reaaaally don't like a 9-5 as it eats all the good time out of life. 

Having been to 3 crazy parties of the same kind, making each time new friends and dressing up in aetheric outfits.

Last month laid first steps to something very life-changing, very excited to see where it goes:

Heard this phrase of ""you can choose your thoughts yourself, instead of them flying into your head"". Have also discovered a very interesting state of mind, rooted in playfulness towards life and somewhat flirtiness? So funny:)

Very excited for 2025. Have big plans:)

Wishing you a lovely New Year and please journal on the change of years. It's a magical time! If you don't know what questions to ask yourself, Google or ask chatGPT. Maybe write a letter to yourself 365 days into the future:)",excited,Happy

"I felt overwhelming joy for the first time in years today  For background I’ve been suffering from a pretty deep depression for the past 6 years or so. And for the past couple days I’ve been at home sick with the flu. So I’ve been forced to take a break. And today I decided to listen to some scores from the Star Wars film soundtracks because I saw a guy talking about it online. I decided to put on Across the stars, and it made me so happy. So happy I started to bawl my eyes out. When I was a kid Star Wars was my favorite thing in the whole wide world, it was the thing that me and my best friend bonded over. I would listen to Star Wars film scores as a kid to fall asleep. It just brought back so many emotions. I feel so overwhelmed with joy and it’s so cathartic. And so unexpected. I hadn’t watched or engaged in star wars content in 6 years during my depression. It’s like seeing an old friend. ",excited,Happy
"new resident (both in the medical sense and living sense) to Colorado, have seen our neighborhood bald eagle 3(-5?) times now 🥹 all spotted while driving around (within a 10-15 mile radius) from our apartment!

I’m an internal medicine resident, and I worked on Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. It’s been a rewarding but also extremely challenging first 6 months as a doctor. So many cultures view eagles as a spiritual sign, and to have one visit me/us so many times has felt like a kind of spiritual encouragement.

"I’ve had the best Christmas despite not having anything on the table. I get 2 spend it with the 2 love of my life. 

I was so close to giving up my 2 dogs for adoption. Things this year has been nothing but rough and I dreaded for Christmas to come since I feel like there is nothing to celebrate. I was so scared for the past couple of weeks that I’ve failed my dogs, run out of insulin for my diabetic dog so I had to consider adoption but Christmas do really come with miracles since some unexpected money came and I was able to get my dog some insulin for the next 2 weeks which would buy me time to figure things out.

Im just genuinely happy that I still get to be with my dog. I probably wont be able to afford to celebrate new year but who cares as long as my dogs are with me ill be the happiest girl there is. 

Any advice on where I can get dog food as well? Im running out and the shelter where I get it has been closed during the holiday seasons which doesnt make sense. Anything as well to make rice taste a lot better?

"First time having a lengthy conversation with my mum.  I'm 26(M) and this is the first time I'm spending Christmas alone. (I was staying with my parents after university up until March this year when my parent's business crumbled and they had to sell the house we were leaving in to pay back a bank loan and they moved back to the village and I ended up renting in the city alone)

I didn't do much for Christmas of course but I treated myself to some nice lunch at a nearby restaurant.

I spent the better part of the day just doom-scrolling in bed till my mum called late in the evening.

I'm African and the relationship with my parents is bitter-sweet and we don't have a strong emotional bond like it's sold in most western movies let alone anything to discuss. It's basically the traditional African-esque relationship where the family is like the army where there's mutual respect but zero emotions at all.

So for a long time, conversations with both my parents on the phone have never lasted more than a minute, it's always straight to the point interrogation-like conversations.

Today however was so different, my mum initially called looking for help about some settings on her phone. after taking her through it and having having her issue resolved, she went on to ask me how I was doing and how I was spending christmas. and of course we went through our usual question-answer ""interrogation"".

I don't know whether it was something in the air or it actually was the ""Christmas spirit"", but we continued talking for a little while longer than we usually do. It felt awkward at first but we just kept on going.

It was so different this time round I even thought for a second that I was talking to someone else. She talked with this calmess and tranquility and soon we were just chatting away, I don't even remember half of the conversation we had.

There's that African fear/respect we were taught to have for parents growing up and so having a candid conversation with a parent is something I never quite thought was possible. And the fact that she was just so jolly and laughing out loud without any ""mask"" during the conversation kinda melted my heart.

There's that judgemental, assertive and authoritative tone most african parents always used when we were kids that kinda of acts as a catalyst in us building these emotional walls most of us have around our parents and sort of makes up keep our parents at arms distance. But this time when were talking, I could sense that it wasn't there. It was just her

What I thought was going to be a 2 minute conversation ended up being a 2 hour emotional roller-coaster and it could have been longer had her battery not died out.

When she hung up, I couldn't believe what had just happened and found myself so emotional and was crying(something I hadn't done since my days in high school). I was so happy and in that moment, I felt so full of life.

If anything, this has got to be the experience of my year and for it to happen on Christmas felt like the perfect gift for me.

Even now I still can't believe it happened and just find myself smiling everytime I remember it and it's the best feeling in the world man.",excited,Happy
"My birds have been so brave recently, and began trusting me more! We've had budgies (Angel and Charlie) for 3-4 years. Today I was putting a new toy in for them for Christmas(I'm putting another one in later and then gonna change their food), and they were so brave. They used to be terrified at any change, and while they're still scared, they were way calmer! I'm so proud of them, and happy that they're trusting me and the rest of my family more! I love them so much, they truly make my day ❤️❤️ They're singing is beautiful. I love them.

I met a lot of nice people and i was a bit nervous about being alone there but i met a guy who was also there on his own and we talked for most of the whole time and he was really nice and friendly. The event was passing out food, clothes, supplies. Was worried about being alone this xmas but I’m actually happy right now :)",excited,Happy

"I had an incredible year and I’m excited for the next!!! At the beginning of the year, I wrote down some resolutions and posted them on Reddit(got into some argument with a mod and lost that account but wtv). They included firstly to graduate, go vegan, and better my French. I not only graduated with good grades from my toxic uni and healed my broken mental state, but also got to work at my dream organisation. I'm not vegan yet but I've greatly reduced my animal products consumption and I'm volunteering in the animal welfare space. My French isn't perfect but half my social media is French memes and TikTok's so I'm forcing myself to at least passively practice. I also made new friends and strengthened old friendships which was HUGE for an introvert like me looking for people to do cool stuff with. 

Next year I'm starting a new position at work better than what im currently in, im working on projects that excite me in the things I'm volunteering for, and a guy who's kinda cute asked me on a date, so maybe that will lead somewhere idk. Im just so happy!!!

There have been lows too, really terrible, soul crushing lows. But I'm glad I am in a new chapter, have renewed confidence and am actually really beginning to feel like an adult. It took me a long time to get this peace and I could just cry from joy.

My only hope is that next year will be even better <3",excited,Happy

He saved me and has blessed me with a hot tub! eeeep mukyu.  i am so happy at the moment ✨  so basically like, i had an extremely bad year at college 😭 and i got put on academic probation (yea yea i know there will people calling me out, go ahead u nerdsss 🤓) and during this break, i had to move back with my bad family which forced me to sleep in the living room with 20 cats 🐈 and would go out there while i slept and make enough noise to wake the dead...ON PURPOSE.. 😫😫😫 plus my family is a pain to live with since they dont have jobs nor the ability to manage money, so they constantly hound me for money but i dont give them any cause they will just spend it on pop, weed, and fast food.

seeing no other options, i decided to look into finding my own place with my savings.  today i found a really nice and CHEAP listing for a room for rent near me that was legit 350 a month.  i gasped, danced, shook with excitement, curled my toes, and jumped up in down... what a deal! 🤝💼✅ plus it says that's all i need to pay, no bills or anything.

i called the guy who made the ad, and he told me i could move in whenever i wanted, and he told me a bunch of things about him, the house, and the other roommates that indicate ""wow he's so chill"".  my favorite things about him is he says he has a hot tub 🛁🧖‍♀️ i can use whenever (you are true sigma and the coolest if you have one), that him and all the other roommates are ex military or current military🪖 (very disciplined and i imagine easy to live with compared to my family) and that he will even pick me up and help me move my things tomorrow with his car, because i dont have a car or license (will fix that soon, vroom vroom initial d ⛐)

the cherry on top of the cake?  the one thing that told me ""wow this guy is human""? he tells me that since it's so close to 2025, if i moved in tomorrow, i could just write my rent check on jan 1st and live there for free until then.  ""to see if you like it"" is what he said.

he was able to pick me up today for a tour, and OMG.  the house is perfect!  big and the other roommate i met was so nice!  my room was so big and my bed so bouncy and big (judge me idc i like jumping on beds) rn i am fantasizing about relaxing in that hot tub christmas eve🎄tomorrow, drinking ramune from walmart and playing with my rubber duck toy.  i hope i can have my laptop close and reply to newer comments on this post, all in the nice warm water.  then i want to fall asleep in my big bed safe n' warm.  life is going to get very good come tomorrow, when i will move.  i will get a job (easy in my town, lots of stuff) and study coding hard and fix the college issue when im not working.  luckily, if all this stuff trying to fix my life gets too much, i will have a hot tub to retreat to.",excited,Happy
"I had a really awesome day with my brother! I have a brother who's 14 (nearly 15) years younger than me. My relationship with my family has never been good, and my family in general is all fractured and very broken. Growing up I was concerned for my brother and the way he was being raised, he was spoilt and had incredibly soft parenting, so I took the role of the grumpy one who gave him hard rules and boundaries, but I did it because I cared greatly for him. One of my biggest fears was my my brother realising I'm gay and not liking me any more, it's been ages since I felt fear around my sexuality, yet this terrified me. Like I said, my family situation is messy, but I really want a happy relationship with him

A few times my brother's came over to my place, and we'll scream and cry with laughter, we're both gamers, so we just play games together and have so much fun! I think he likes that I've never gone easy on him, I always make him work for a victory and don't like to treat him like a child. And, yeah, I know he knows I'm gay now, but it's never been an issue, that means so much to me

Today however we went and saw Sonic 3 in the cinema, just the two of us, and it made my soul happy getting to just watch a film with him, laugh together, then talk about it with each other. I have memory issues, so for an early Christmas present and to tie the memory to something physical, I got us both these Sonic popcorn buckets, he seemed super happy about it and really grateful! He's 14 now, so he's maturing and changing, I mentioned one of my favourite jokes in the movie and asked if he understood it, and he said with a really confused face ""What? The scene where the woman hands them two crossbows and one's a lot smaller than the o-"" then he started half smiling and half laughing as he went ""Aaaahhh"" and just seeing him work that out, it keeps making me laugh! :')

I was always so scared he'd hate me, I was strict, I said no a lot, I could be mean. But no one else would be that person, he needed it so I knew I had to be. So the fact he still likes to spend these moments with me, he text me the other day to show me he started playing Kingdom Hearts 3 again. Life really hasn't been great in general, but knowing my brother likes me and wants to share moments like this with me, it means more to me than I can put into words. It's really made me truly happy getting to spend a part of my day with him, and he mentioned he'd love to watch Jurassic Park in 4D with me in the future if it comes back! It makes me so happy, I really am grateful for this relationship",excited,Happy
"I get to spend the night with my mom for the first time in 10 years!

"My boyfriend’s love languages perfectly line up with mine My boyfriend’s love languages are gift giving and physical contact. 

I for one in my one past relationship always was the gift giver but it turns out thats actually what I wanted to receive FROM a partner. 
It’s more so for me the actual act of: I have been thinking of you and I know you well enough to know what you like, and I went out of my way and spent time looking for this thing. 

I find it really sweet and anyway my boyfriend got me an advent calendar after asking me out because Ive never had one before (and my last many Christmases have been traumatic.) Along with that he got the exact teddy I have been wanting. He is such a sweetie pie.

"After YEARS of extensive therapy, I no longer qualify for PTSD - I am so unbelievably happy  
I'm going to buy myself a cake to

"I'm crying out of joy for a first time in my life... I don't know where to start. I'm 26yo male that changed his own life in 6 months - I was fat, I was in a relationship for 4 years I knew that was leading nowhere, I was too in my comfort zone (introverted as fuck) and I don't know what else ...

  
Half a year back I started to be really dissapointed about my shape so I started walking 10K steps every day and started counting calories to be in a deficit. After 6 months I lost 25kg which made me look really different (obviously).

In past 4 years I was really closed up, didn't engage in any type of new friendships, no social activities etc

After 4 years of my a wee bit toxic relationship that I knew was leading nowhere, because she way too often reminded me about she didn't want any kids or marry me and some other things. I finally found that bit of ""courage"" and broke up with her in November.  4 years is a really long time and I was really afraid that I would feel so damn lonely especially at this time of year and in a flat where it is just me and my dog - GUESS WHAT! I feel no such thing as sad or lonely, only ""negative"" thing is that I didn't do that earlier but I'm not going to take that feeling any further - why?

What is happening now or since those 6 months?

* Became more ""stress free""
* Lost weight (still have to get rid of loose skin but fuck it, I will be able to do that!)
* Noticed that a really cute girl was smiling at me so I made my move and brought her out on a 2nd date (I blow up the 1st one but this time I was doing good and it felt more natural) that she is the first person ever to tell me I'm looking handsome and that she loves my eyes. We are able to just talk for literally hours and never get rid of topics.  At work I'm going by her and we stare at each other with a smile.
*  I was (for the first time) on a company Christmas party where I got drunk, danced after random girl came to me and dragged me to a dance floor and I loved every minute of it (until the morning hangover hit me).
* Got really close to a few of my workmates and realized how such a great people they are and how they supported me before/after break up and how they motivated me to be better in my personal life.
* I bought new clothes I'm finally comfortable in.
* All of sudden I realized that young girls (19-25yo) are either giving me ""the look"" or started OUT OF NOWHERE talking to me. I'm still not used to this, but damn it feels good. And I hope I'm not dreaming or imagining things since they smile at me and asking me random stuff that are not related to our/mine job.

I don't know what else to say ... I woke up at night and started thiking about that all and ended up crying out of joy. I just have the feeling that I'm finally myself. That I'm thankful for those coworkers and new friends around me. That I was able to say to myself ""do this, do that - it is neccessary"" and really took those steps to be better, to be what I'm now. It took time, some things wasn't that pleasant, but in the end it has to be done. My workmates (the are all females) told my that I'm a man any girl would want: I know my priorities, I'm not stupid, I can handle stuff, I'm calm, I can take care of things and that I'm handsome (like what the hell is happening around me?)

I don't want to compare my troubles with someone else who might be in a worse position, because **comparison is a thief of joy** and I don't want to feel sorry for what I'm doing. I'm writing all this because I'm happy and I want to pass the message that anyone can do anything.

I have some plans for myself, because I don't want to say ""okay, I achieved everything I wanted"". No. I want to feel that ""phase 1 ended, phase 2 started"" - I want to start jogging, hitting the gym, maybe try to start with box, but I should definitely take some dance classes to really overcome my fear of dance floor and be more relaxed. Maybe apply for army reserves ... so much ahead, but I love it.",excited,Happy

"I’ve sent email to myself during my teenagehood , it made me smile to receive it only now, and I wanted to share it because I don’t know I like the way it’s kinda cringe  Dear Future Me,

I hope you’re feeling better today. You’re reading this message from your 16-year-old self. Honestly, I know you hate thinking about the past, but just let it go.

I really hope you didn’t ruin my dream of studying psychology at university, because you’re absolutely capable of it, you idiot.

I also hope things are better in your life now… That dad is still around, that you’ve made friends—both girls and guys—and that you’ve managed to keep them. Back in 2020, I’m feeling terrible because of Juliette and this constant loneliness. Please don’t make me go through that again at your age.

But anyway, don’t worry. Everything will turn out fine. Remember, whenever we’ve wanted something, we’ve always ended up achieving it in the end. Stay a good person—I didn’t make all these sacrifices for you to turn into a complete jerk.

I don’t know about you, but here, I’m still a huge fan of comics, and Spider-Man is still the most inspiring character. Never stray from the right path: “When you can help someone, you have a moral obligation to do so.”

I trust you, future me. You’re (my age) now. You have responsibilities, duties—don’t give up, I’m really counting on you.

Alright, I’ll stop here. I’ve got some ironing to do. Have a great day, and happy birthday, Raph (I just hope no one’s still calling you “Loulou” by now—it’s unbearable).

You’ve come such a long way…

Okay, for real, I’ll leave you alone now. But if you’re reading this with someone you love, hold onto her with everything you’ve got. Love her endlessly. Don’t make the same mistakes I did. Don’t be stupid. Give me the chance to feel happy and fulfilled too.

Alright, I’m done for real this time. (I hope you’ve stayed handsome.)",excited,Happy
"I have four university interviews and waiting for an invite to my fifth choice. Paramedicine 2025! I have overcome a lot of battles with mental health and trauma. I am still am working on some struggles but I'm more stronger now. 

I am going to uni next year and have met the grades on my current course. I've got mostly distinctions (think of that as an A+) on most units including all of my biology. I've got top grades. 

So I have met the entry requirements for my chosen universities. 

2025 is going to be a challenge, however I am most excited to take on new challenges and responsibilities.

"I am doing a perspective of my life and I am glad I overstepped the alcohol “is cool” The first time I drank alcohol—not just sneaking a sip from my dad’s glass—was when I was 18. Before that, I had always refused to drink because my parents had issues with alcohol at home, and I wanted nothing to do with it. When I finally did, it was during a party, and it went really well—I had fun with my friends, no regrets.

For about a year after that, I started partying a lot and drinking pretty often. But now, honestly, I barely drink anymore. I’ll have a drink during specific events, like parties, but when I do drink, I go all in—not just a little sip. That said, I only ever drink with my friends. I’ve never drunk in front of my parents or my siblings, and with my girlfriend, it’s at most a glass on a terrace.

These days, I party much less because, well, adult life and less free time. Surprisingly, I don’t miss it at all—I’m perfectly fine with it
I know that sounds stupid but I am in my 20s and I am surprised that some people sometimes judge me when I say I don’t want to go out drinking.

"I love late spring and I cant wait for it. I live in Texas so late spring is awesome. Walking out on a warm summer evening when the sun hasnt set yet and theres a small little breeze. Getting to go out and swim with my friends, staying out late because the sun sets later and no stress.

"Dreams do come true. Finally saw the Antelope Canyon in AZ. What a majestic place to visit.  Always dreamt of visiting this place.

"I checked my emails this morning and saw that I finally graduated community college after transferring to a different school almost 2 years ago! It’s about damn time!

I went to my local community college starting in 2021, and after a lot of miscommunication, misunderstanding, and being screwed out of degree credits because of technicality and semantics,  I would have had to wait an entire year to take only 2 classes to get the degree I was in. I decided to miss out on getting my diploma and transfer out to a four year school to work on a degree thats related to what I was doing initially but more aligned with my goals for the future, BUT when I was setting up my transfer between schools, I met with my advisor and opted to back-transfer the credits I achieved at the new school.

Thankfully I did that because now I am finally receiving my associates! Time to conquer this bachelors!",excited,Happy
"I got a lot going on that I am proud of, but I spoil my own happiness. I am at a point inmy life where I feel proud of myself for what I’ve been through and what I overcame. I would say that 2024 was truly my year and I can’t wait for what 2025 holds in store.

During covid - like many - I was depressed, alcoholic and in debt. I’m proud to say that I am in a better mental state, no longer an alcoholic and I turned my debt into savings. And I am in the process of opening my own business on top of losing ton of weight and getting in shape.I’ve done a lot and I am proud of it.. Kind of.

I know that this is a feel happy subreddit, but I have a twist. I think that I have a severe case of imposter syndrome. I’m getting a lot of compliments and attention. People around me say that my transformation is inspiring them. But deep down, I feel like I don’t deserve it for some reason.

Like, I know I should be happy, and I am on some level. But it feels like it is one step removed. Like I am happy for someone else. I feel guilt, like nothing good should ever happen to me for some reason and I do not want to feel that way.

I want to be truly happy. I want to be proud of my accomplishment, cause I know that I’ve earned it and I want to celebrate it.

Till that happens, I’m gonna fake it till I make it into happines and say fuck yeah I’m happy!!

"Super grateful to be here 🙏🏼Moved to the US in 2020 with one suitcase, no family. No risk, no story.  Just found this subreddit today and felt like this would be a great place to share something happy. Moved to the US in 2020 all by myself with one suitcase, very little money and no family. I always knew as a kid I belonged here and would always dream of living in this country. Well, hard work and determination pays off. 

I had just graduated from college. I had been in the US multiple times before, so this was my final decision to move mid Covid as there was only one charter flight. 

In the past 4 years, I have learned how to thrive on my own, put one foot in front of the other and make my dreams come true. I am beyond thankful and grateful for all the blessings in my life, all the lessons and people I’ve met here. It’s been a great journey. And I am thankful to be able to help my family as well. 

I hope that this post inspired someone out there. No matter the circumstances, you can do it. The Universe has your back! 🤍🙏🏼",excited,Happy
"I just got my genetic testing back! My heart is not going to explode! My family has a genetic disease called Loeys-Dietz syndrome. It's also known as Familial Aortic Dissection Disorder. Basically, at any point in our life (but usually between the ages of 45-60), our aorta can basically decide to split and burst. According to my sister, it feels like if someone ripped apart your chest with their bare hands. 

While it is usually something that you worry about later in life, our family has historically been affected by it at a young age. My sister had her first dissection at 18. Her second on her 30th birthday. My other sister recently had her first dissection at 35. It is by luck that both of them survived it. It usually is a death sentence. It has killed quite a few family members, and there are several others who died of random ""cardiac issues"" before we had a diagnosis. 

With my sister getting it this last year, that met the threshold for the insurance company to cover the genetic testing. We had to have 5 family members experience a dissection *and* test positive for the gene. The chances of inheriting the gene are 50/50. You either have it or you don't. 

I just heard back! I don't have the gene. I've lived with this for 15 years! Getting regular echocardiograms, CT scans, etc. I always lived under the assumption that I had it and it would get me. But not anymore! ",excited,Happy

"Every single prayer I have done since converting few months ago to Christianity has been answered in unexplainable ways. I just want to be happy and share my happiness. 

I pray daily, not to always just ask for stuff of if im needing help of course but to give thanks, so i am able to still know every single thing i have prayed about that WAS about a question, help with a situation, to know next steps on something, etc. 

I even let God know, that only if its in alignment with his will- that if i am meant to suffer through it- of course let me- but even then- sometimes same day, next day- never longer than a week, my answer is given real unexplainably to have been coincidence, my whole entire situations turned completly upside down to good WITH extra good in turn, thoughts i struggle with replaced. 

  
I know in the christian religion it was said that he answers all prayers, even thuogh we dont notice or its suffering instead to receive the inheritance later- but to imagine this type of love that god has for us and that i would ever actually experience it- i would have never thought possible in all my life. 

  
i just wanted to share my happiness is finding love. fixing my wrongs. being a better person. and changing my life with accountability, and in ways that are not human hands.

"My wife healed a 35 year old wound I didn’t know I had When I was 4 or 5, my best friend and I were obsessed with Ghostbusters (this was either 1989 or 1990). He and I both had a Ghostbusters mylar balloon and I loved mine. 

One day, I got hurt playing outside and my mom told me to come in to get cleaned off and bandaged up. She said she’d tie my balloon off so it didn’t go anywhere. However, it did. I watched it slip away and float into the sky. I stared at the blue until I couldn’t see the balloon anymore. I cried and cried. Apparently I even turned to my friend and said “I wish it had been yours”. 

That was one of my earliest memories. 

I’ve told this story to my wife countless times in our relationship. Today, she surprised me. She said that for my birthday tomorrow she was giving me a Ghostbusters themed birthday party and had ordered two Ghostbuster Mylar balloons from 1984 on eBay. I was stunned. A huge smile on my face. 

When she pulled them out of the pack and showed me, there were instant tears and a 35 year old wound that I didn’t know was there was being healed. I was a kid again in an instant. 

It’s the sweetest most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me. All I can say is that I love this woman, she’s the best, she’s my best friend, and I definitely married up. ",excited,Happy

"I have the privilege of providing my daughter her own bedroom and I’m so happy I could cry So I’m a single dad to a 4 year old little girl, we’ve had a pretty tough year since her step mom left us (I discovered an ongoing affair and divorced her October ‘23). We were married for 3 years and together for 4, my little girl knew her as mom. It was so hard seeing my daughter’s heart break at that loss. It made it hard for me to notice my own heartbreak. And on top of it all, I let my career sit to the side for my ex’s, effectively making her the primary breadwinner when I discovered the affair. So when we split I didn’t have the income to provide for me and my daughter. Talk about panic and stress. Was I going to have to move in with my parents? 

But as of tonight, I am able to independently provide a place to live for me and my daughter. She’s been having to swap between my parents and my best friend’s house where I’ve been couch surfing since January, and it’s just been so tough not having a place that’s “home”. Well, I took a crazy risk and changed careers and it has really worked out. I spent this weekend moving into our new apartment and getting her bedroom ready. Her excitement at her very own room again brings me to tears every time I think about it. We spent the afternoon at the pool and she made a bunch of new friends with other kids here. 

It really wasn’t that long ago that I felt completely hopeless. I never thought I’d feel the way I do now again. Right now, I’m happy.  ",excited,Happy

"I said ""no"" when I was offered my drug of choice for the first time ever  Been on Xanax heavily since 2015. There was a point that the sound of pill bottles rattling instantly made my mouth water. I've been through multiple OD's... Homeless, and everything in between over this drug. There were times when I truly felt like I could not live without it, and completely gave up on the idea of ever having a normal life. 

Had my 2nd stint in rehab after an OD Dec 2023, and have been sober from it ever since. Today, while walking  into a convenient store, some guy asked if I smoked weed, which led to him asking if I do any other drugs (I don't). Eventually he asked me if I did Xanax, and I felt instantly dread wash over me, instead of the happiness knowing I found another potential dealer.

I told him no, but to stay safe out there, and walked away. I have never once said no to Xanax in the 10 years I've been battling this terrible disease. And for the first time in a very long time, I feel like maybe I'll be okay.  I cried from happiness when I got home, and it feels like the sun might shine a little brighter tomorrow.

"After 26 months of unemployment, missing meals and falling behind: I got my dream job designing the Empire State Building!!! 🥳🥹🤩😭 The journey to get here has been the single most challenging, grueling, and exhausting struggle of my life - and it's finally, finally, finally over!!  Every day I woke up, logged onto my phone, and filled out applications. I searched and re-searched for every possible job. I lowered my expectations until I was looking up at the Grand Canyon. I waited and waited and waited on staffing agencies who gushed over my resume, only to ghost me. I made it to dozens of interviews and the job was either put on hold, they ghosted me, or they ""went with another candidate whose qualifications better match our needs at this time. We will keep your application on file for future opportunities."" 

Meanwhile, bills piled up. I'd run out of food and have my phone cut off until my friend could help. It was humiliating and infuriating, especially because I'd make it to the altar of a job only to be stood up with no explanation. Still, I held onto the tiny thread of hope that somehow my life would work out; somehow there was the perfect position for me. I listened to self-development teachers who had experienced loss and suffering and overcome it to great success. 

One of them shared that he would write his desire on paper and act as if he already had what he wanted. Rhonda Byrne, author of The Secret, had taught this too. So, I wrote myself an offer of employment and looked at it each week, getting excited as if it were physically real; as if I really did have my dream job. I got into the feeling of being employed and walked around the city listening to podcasts on consciousness, self-development, and mindset.

It took months of patience and practice, but I finally got the interview that led to the real offer. And the position includes meals, benefits, and the nicest people. I get to beautify a company with multiple floors of the Empire State Building and everything I had asked to manifest did!! This is the happiest I have ever been in my life 🥹 and the best part is they are allowing me to bring my paintings (I'm an artist) and sell them. This is huge for me especially because I only survived the pandemic thanks to my art and have never had formal wall space for people to see them. (I lost my job and everything else during the pandemic.)  It took all of me to believe I could have this, and now my happiness is as tall as the Empire State! 

If you're currently struggling, please believe in your dreams, your goals, and your desires. Even if it's a molecule of hope, let that little light be your guide. You got this ✨️🙌✨️

"Made dinner for my pregnant wife and daughter and they told me how much I mean to them.  

My pregnant wife and 9 year old daughter requested breakfast for dinner so I made a big batch of scrambled eggs with buttery toast and turkey bacon and proceeded to serve my girls their plates and hang out with them on the couch while Netflix played in the background, my daughter gave me a big hug and told me how good dinner was and thanked me for cooking for her and my wife told me how much she appreciated me as she finished her dinner and I played with her hair; with them both telling me how much they loved me and telling me that I take good care of them. I didn't come from the best family or have the happiest childhood and I like to think that I've broken the cycle with my own family. I feel like the richest man on the planet. Life is good and I didn't think I'd ever have half of what I have. I'm feeling blessed. Glad I stayed to see myself get this far. Life is beautiful. ",excited,Happy

Last night we were talking in bed and I said something that got an unexpected response. After a little back and forth, I thought we were headed in a bad direction, so I said it. Jamaica! I started to explain why I said it and my wife interrupted me, Jamaica! We just repeated Jamaica a few times and then kissed. it was awesome.

"My life is perfect again. 7 years of chronic pain gone in 3 days. I've suffered from intense chronic pain in my shoulders, neck, and back since 2017. Living with this pain every day felt like being trapped in a never-ending feverish dream. I couldn't take photos, make videos, or create any art because of it. If I did manage to make something, the pain would intensify for days afterward. I also struggled with severe anemia, to the point where I had to take up to three naps a day.

I consulted three spine specialists, underwent over 20 physical therapy sessions, and even tried epidural injections but nothing worked. I considered suicide many times, but I had an old iPad and Procreate. Drawing became my escape from the hell I was living in. I tried everything, icing, heat, muscle relaxants... but nothing provided relief.

Recently, I was diagnosed with IBS and switched to a low FODMAP diet. Almost immediately, I started feeling more energized. My joints stopped becoming inflamed, and my body slowly returned to how it was before 2017. Now, I can exercise, move freely, and have energy. My mind is clear, and I finally feel like my old self again.

Honestly, I'm so incredibly happy. I wanted to share this in case anyone else is going through something similar.",excited,Happy

"After four long, hard years, I graduated college debt free. It was not easy, and I feel so accomplished being on the other side of this journey. I graduated college!

These last four years have been really hard. 2020 was a tough year for a lot of people, and those of us in college that year faced unique challenges. On top of that, throughout my collegiate career, I was always working (at one point two jobs) to pay for school because I was determined to graduate debt free. 

It was not easy. I experienced a lot of difficult family trauma, felt some intense heartbreak, and sometimes I wondered if I’d ever make it through school and out of home. 

I finally did it. I graduated debt free, and the last year and a half of college was so healing. I earned scholarships which meant I could work less, which meant less stress. I moved out, which helped immensely with my mental health. I got into therapy and have healed so much. After I was able to work a little less with scholarships, I joined a couple clubs, made friends, and became a student leader serving as Vice President for two student organizations. 

I made it. I am so proud of everything I overcame, all of the opportunities I sought out, and how much I have grown. Most of all, I am proud of what I became for my younger self :) ",excited,Happy

"Feeling Happy & Proud Of Myself After Dropping 42lb Despite Having Autoimmune Disease Hey all. I suffer from an autoimmune disease called Lupus. It gives me super low energy and makes me crave food that worsens my energy levels. Feeling angry with the world and sorry for myself led to lots of bad food decisions and drinking too much.

This year I decided enough was enough. When I chose to do a booze free year, it started a domino effect and I started to crave healthier foods and became interested in badminton which I played 20 years ago.

I did a sponsored swim in August 25km (just under 20 miles) across the month. And I've joined a gym now, bought a pull up bar and am starting my calisthenics journey. I am close to doing my first non band-assisted pull ups which is my goal for the end of the year.

I still want to lose another 30lb of fat and add as much muscle as I can put on through good eating and resistance training. I'm in the best shape I've ever been in at 38 so it goes to show that it's never too late to start making good decisions. ",excited,Happy

"My face after NASA astronaut Jeanette Epps made a surprise call from the International Space Station to congratulate our students on their final day of space STEM camp. My mind is still reeling from it. Even the parents came on the video call afterwards to say how much it meant to have an astronaut call from the ISS. One parent said, “my mouth was agape but what it meant to these kids!” I almost broke down right there.

If there is anything better than to get to facilitate an opportunity such as this to inspire the imaginations of young future astronauts, scientists, and artists, I don’t know what it is. 

Once the video call was over, I bawled. Tears of pure joy. Thank you, universe, for helping inspire the future authors and architects of a world and future worth having! Anything is possible!

I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

"At 23 (almost 24) I’m going to be a mom 🤍 I’ve always wanted to be a mom. I [23F] didn’t think I ever could be because of prior and current health issues. I had surgeries on my ovaries a few years ago that I thought I’d never recover from. I also had a painful miscarriage before and didn’t think I would carry again but it’s happening for me. It’s been a roller coaster of emotions. I’ve been worrying and doubting myself so much, but I’m happy to think of the possibilities with this pregnancy, like when we can travel to Mexico and my 91 yr old grandma gets to meet the baby. I’m doing this alone so it’s even scarier, but I get to have a mini best friend. I’m just about 5 weeks along, and I think the baby will be a girl. I think she’ll have curly hair and long eyelashes. She will be perfect in every way.",excited,Happy

So I haven't been eating my vitamins....my mom went out tonight to get me more and came in. She stole one of my pens and began crossing out something on the vitamin box, so I asked her what she was crossing out.

Turns out she crossed out the ""girl"" so that it only said ""Teen vitamins"" 😭 I'm so happyyyy

"Barbershop was concerned about me, and that made me feel happy 😊 Hello Happy Folks,

I went to my local barbershop yesterday to get a haircut and my regular barber and backup barber were both happy to see me. 

They thought something happened but I told them life was good, and that I waited to get my haircut today because I have a great weekend coming up. 

The fact that they genuinely cared made me so happy, and I gave my barber a nice tip. They ensured I'll be a repeat customer for a long time. 

It's the small act of kindness that makes all the difference in the world. This photo is one I took of my new haircut. 

Have a great day everyone! ",excited,Happy
"My daughter took a bath with her frog that was too warm and I saved its life! Happy Ending I promise!

My 9 year old daughter was taking a bath and wanted her bullfrog to join her.  After just seconds in the tub, the frog must have gone into shock.  My daughter screamed that she thought her frog died, and I ran upstairs.  After feeling how warm the water was, I placed the frog into colder water.  After just a couple of minutes she was hopping around like normal.  Biggest hug I have gotten in a while.  I feel like a hero!

Edit:  My daughter was very distraught during the entire situation.  She understands now to never do this again.  She was just trying to have fun playing in water with her frog.  Luckily, 15 years ago I worked for a pet store and understood that they are exotherms and knew exactly what to do right away.

Edit2:  This was my first post here.  I was just so proud of saving the frog and just wanted to share in case anyone else has a pet frog.  If there is a better sub for shouting nice things from the rooftop let me know!",excited,Happy
"My investigation led to the destruction of a CP selling operation here on Reddit A few months ago, I discovered a group or multiple groups that were using bots to advertise CP Telegram channels and MEGA links here on Reddit. Even worse, the posts they were making included real CP images, and for some reason, it all went under the radar. I have tried multiple times to raise awareness of the situation, but all my attempts failed.

So I started going on mass reporting sprees, checking every few hours and reporting every post that I encountered. This is when I discovered the seller's biggest mistake. Probably trying to show that they are legit, they included alongside CP images, screenshots of conversations between them and buyers. And fortunately, they were stupid enough not to censor personal information. I got names, emails, PayPal usernames, credit cards, and most importantly, MEGA links.

After discovering this, I emailed MEGA about these links and provided them proof that they are related to a CP selling operation. Fortunately, they banned the accounts, which also meant that all their CP folders were gone.

Now, here comes the interesting part. Before I made those reports, there were between 5-10 posts made every minute, they were making posts faster than I was able to report them. Suddenly, this number dropped significantly, [I went from reporting probably over 100 posts per day to 8, and today only one(just images of my Reddit inbox, all SFW).](https://imgur.com/a/reddit-comparision-ej2v7jS)

So, either they had all their material on one MEGA account and they lost everything, or my mass reports led to Reddit cracking down on their bot farms. Either way, those criminals are gone, at least for now.

I have no one, at least no one that would understand this situation, to share the news with, how happy I am that this is finally over and that I won't have to view those disturbing images anymore. So I made this post.

Edit: [Some of the screenshots of conversations and of folders, I have censored the personal information of the people involved so I won't get banned for doxxing. Again, this is all SFW.](https://imgur.com/a/proof-of-coversations-bbnWmnz) Added them in case some people won't believe me",excited,Happy

"Randomly messaged someone on reddit a few months ago. Now just came back from the happiest week of my life with her (Sunsets that we watched together, to catch some attention) 

A couple months ago, I (m19) randomly messaged a girl (f18) and it was the best decision of my life. I was at a bad and lonely time in life, having just moved away from home, feeling very isolated. I would search NSFW and relationship subreddits looking for anything to feel a connection, but nothing. Out of nowhere, a post gets recommended to me but it's wholesome. Nothing particularly dirty about it, just a random request to chat with someone. Purely out of surprise and curiosity, I messaged her, and there hasn't been a single day since that we haven't spoken. We mesh like we are made for each other in a way that i never thought i could with another human. That was well over three months ago. I drove 400 miles to see her and be with her for a week and it's the happiest both of us have been, ever. We spent a week together going all over the region she's from, adding about another thousand miles onto my car, plus the 400 it took to get there. Already planning our next visit, hoping to have her come to my place for Christmas!! Been super happy about this and needed to share. Ama if you want!! If you have a question for her, I'll direct it her way.",excited,Happy

"My husband and I had leftovers for the first time in 8+ years! My husband and I are both very overweight and we tend to binge eat dinner. I grew up in a household of 6+ people and was taught to cook big meals. I honestly have no idea how to cook for just two and usually just stick with the giant meals I was taught. Even if we're full we will eat the entire meal sometimes even saving the rest for a few hours later and calling it ""second dinner"". We realized that this has become a pretty big issue not only with our weight but also with our grocery budget. This past week we were able to successfully take a party size lasagna (that we usually finish in one night) and make it last 3 nights. We added a small salad and a piece of garlic bread on the side to help with the smaller portions and it really helped. I honestly think we could split it into 4 nights next time and be totally fine. It's been 8+ years since we've had leftovers. Only down side is that we had to buy tupperware lol

But I am incredibly proud of us and I hope that we can continue :)",excited,Happy

"I watched someone fall in love with my foster kitten I’m fostering a litter of kittens through a kitty rescue and went to my first adoption event. I was so bummed because the whole time, no one was interested in this baby. Until the very end, a young adult and his older mother came in. I told them how good he was and how he likes to supervise litter box cleanings to make sure you do a good job. They just kind of went, “oh that’s nice” and looked at some other kitties. 

About 20 minutes later, the lady asks if she can hold him. Y’all - it was love at first hold and purr. It was instant. I knew and they knew they found their new best friend. It was probably the most pure interaction I have witnessed. Their application just got approved. Congrats to my baby kitty Poe 🖤🖤",excited,Happy

Happy my wife has agreed to quit smoking.  Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks.

"Our Baby's First Words: The Competition I'm Losing I wanted to share a happy and somewhat competitive tradition in our family that I've lost every time. My wife and I recently welcomed our third son (likely our last ""planned child""), and he’s just about ready to say his first word.

Since our first child, my wife and I have had a friendly competition to see who can get the baby to say ""mama"" or ""dada"" first. It's become a fun and friendly competition for us (we're both very competitive). For context, our first two kids said ""mama"" as their first words, so my wife is on a winning streak!

Here’s the twist: My wife works a high-stress job with long hours, while I’ve been working from home since 2010. While she’s at work, I practice “mama” with our kids. Obviously it's counterproductive, but seeing the joy and pride on my wife’s face when our kids say “mama” first is worth every second. I've never told her this and I likely won't, even when she's doing her victory lap and celebration dances.

Now, our third little one is getting ready to speak, and the excitement is building up again. No matter who wins (although my money is on my wife getting the hatrick on this one), I think it's a win all the way around. This is definitely one of the highlights of parenting so far for me.

Any other ""gracious losers"" in here with me? ",excited,Happy

"My boyfriend called my dad “Dad” for the first time My boyfriend called him “Dad”

Last weekend was my parents 50th wedding anniversary, which is enough to make you smile! My family got together to celebrate, which included my boyfriend of almost seven years. 

He has a great relationship with my parents, but this was a first. As we were leaving he said, “I love you, Dad”. He has a VERY fraught relationship with his dad, so this moment was so sweet. 

Later, my dad texted that he was overwhelmed with emotion in the moment, but that he was proud that my boyfriend feels that close and he couldn’t ask for a better son. I’m still tearing up writing this. 

Historically, my partners have been kinda crappy and none have really had much of a relationship with my parents. Also, my boyfriend and I have had issues and recently our connection has been really amazing because of all the work we’ve been doing. So this moment was so heartwarming on many levels. 💕

Just wanted to share!",excited,Happy

Id been gaining weight in college before that but the pandemic took it out of control. 


I weighed in today at 328.6
I haven't weighed this low in 2 years


My goal is 250. Not my permanent goal but if i can get there, i think ill have the discipline to train my body to do that i want to do and feel the way i want to feel about my body. Its taken a lot of self love and support from my partner to get where i am but ive got a long road ahead of me.

The other night her friends were teasing me as to when I was going to ask her out. I didn’t realise they knew I had a huge crush on her. I then got to talk to her and asked her out for a whole day/date. I said I wanted to make her happy and give her an awesome day to remember and hopefully make more happy memories to come, and she said yes. I tried to hide my excitement but as soon as I stopped talking to them that night I was giggling like a little school girl. I’m taking her out next weekend and I have a whole day planned.

"Spent all weekend playing with my 4 year old daughter and she kept crying ""tears of happiness"".  I love playing with my daughter. We spent all weekend running errands, playing tag, playing rollercoaster pov in front of the tv among other things she likes. She can be very emotional and I encourage her to communicate what she's feeling. In the middle of playing she sometimes starts tearing up and when I ask her why she says she loves me and that they're ""happy tears"". 

This morning I was in the bathroom getting ready for work and I hear her sobbing as she waddles in, groggy and sobbing. She starts climbing all over me not able to get words out. And after a minute or so of comforting her she tells me she's gonna ""miss me or something"". 

I set her up with her mom on the couch and told her before she knows it I'll be back home to play and that I'll miss her too. Then I left home with a full heart. I love my kid :)",excited,Happy

At first, it felt like a chore, but now it’s something I actually look forward to. It’s helped me feel calmer, more focused, and way less stressed. Honestly, I’m just proud of myself for showing up every day.

"After 3,000 job applications I finally got a ""real"" job Something that for so many people, including all of my friends is so normal it's to be expected but for whatever reason escaped me for years.

I graduated with my bachelor's and basically walked into Covid. The job market was upside down for my industry. 

All I could get was 10-99 contract jobs at startups that promised me the moon and ended up screwing me over.

Through my bachelor's I worked so many internships and part time jobs in the industry so I already had a decent amount of both work and academic experience, but it didn't matter.

This may sound exaggerated but I promise it's not. I've probably applied to 3,000 jobs in my lifetime. Each of those jobs requiring me to upload my resume, then manually type in everything on my resume, and all the nonsense in today's job application world. 

I probably secured five interviews out of those 3,000 applications, and no offers. 

So to make ends meet, I took what I could. I worked as a contractor for these early stage startups. Every single one of them promised me full-time employment, High salary, benefits, all of it. ""We just needed X first."" X being investment usually. 

Every single one of them at some point I would wake up, hop on a call, and get told it was over and the company was shutting down. No warning, no severance, and when I protested ""this is how I pay my rent, you've been telling me for months this was on track for bigger things"" I was told ""well you're an independent contractor so that's really your responsibility.""

Some of them just ghosted me, one ghosted me after over 200 hours of unpaid work I did for ""equity""

Am I at fault for working with people who didn't have contracts with guarantees? Yeah. But I was in my early 20s and desperate because I had no other option. Lessons learned, and learned hard.

But now, I'm starting a new job in 2 weeks - at a high school. Not only is this job a W-2 job, it has a contract. Not only does it have a contract, it has a union, benefits, and a pension.

The starting pay isn't great, and here I am at 28 with 9 years of work experience, not a penny saved to show for it, starting at a salary that keeps me in my parents house... But I don't care.

God damnit I have a contract, benefits, and a union. I cannot wait to pay my union dues. I will do so with a smile on my face.

The salary will increase eventually to a high middle class pay, and this is guaranteed with my contract.

After 6 years of watching all my friends seamlessly just ""get a job"" I finally did. 

Gone are the days where any morning I could wake up and have my entire financial stability shattered over a zoom call and get told ""I'm just an independent contractor so f*ck you""

I still can't believe it.

I'm so happy, I'm so relieved. All I've wanted is stability and I finally have it.",excited,Happy

"A year back, I was living in a forty year old trailer with the floors caving out of it. Now I'm sitting in the backyard of my house with a fire, a drink and a book. I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.",excited,Happy
"Latest check in on my weight loss journey. This gives me a sense of accountability to internet strangers.  Backstory: 59 year old male, just over 250 pounds, high blood pressure, surgeries on both knees, tired of just being tired.

Things are coming along nicely. I have gone from 40 inch waist clothing being tight to 34 inch waist clothing being too loose. I have to update most of my wardrobe. Joining the gym was a great idea. Small town gym with no judgement, just support.

The scale picture was taken after an intense workout, so is not entirely accurate. I was down a bit due to sweat. Still, I am very happy with my progress.",excited,Happy
"I told my homophobic parents about my queer relationship, and they were happy about it! I've struggled with my parents for years. They're Christians with strong opinions, and we've had a very rough past, with me being disowned years ago for coming out. We were disconnected for some time, but it slowly got better. I had trouble seeing how our relationship could develop beyond the hurt. 

Today I decided to bite the bullet, and tell them about my partner, almost expecting them to disown me again. It took a few hours for them to respond, but the message was how much they loved me from head to toe, how proud they are and that they're happy I've found someone special.

I couldn't in a million years see this coming, so this is such a big weight off my shoulders. I almost feel like I have a new chance at life.

I'M SO HAPPY",excited,Happy

"Diet soda is amazing!! Feels like a cheat code I’ve only tried diet soda once and hated it

Stopped having sodas ages ago (health), and only have water now

Well, on a whim I decided to try a diet soda again and my god!! There so many options these days!!

It feels like a cheat code in life, this shouldn’t be allowed.

Coming from water this stuff tastes amazing!!

I was so happy about this “discovery” that this store worker and I started comparing notes on our favorite diet sodas.

Just felt like sharing this insignificant thing that’s honestly made me so much happier lol. I love it

Hope your day is going well!

"Surprising my little girl with ""BIG"" Halloween decorations is the key to happiness this week! My little girl was getting FOMO from all of the Halloween decorations going up around the neighborhood, so I thought I'd surprise her while my wife and daughter were out today. I spent the week gathering the stuff. 200lbs of sandbags, lots of extension cords and guy lines, a bajillion trips up and down the ladder and scrambling to get it done before they got back, all for a few moments of excitement and a smile on her face.

"I’m happy with my own take on this diy-ish costume, holy guacamole 🥑😇✨ This halloween I embraced a classic saying as a costume with my own artistic twist. I wasn’t sure how much effort I wanted to put this year, but I’m happy I pushed myself. I initially bought a $16 costume and repurposed the wings / tutu underneath a dress I had. I also sewed lights (not shown on pics) on the wings + headband and crafted glitter paper chips / guac. I tried adding extra pizzazz with some gem stones on my face and some chips on my earrings lol.

This was really fun to make, I’m so happy with how it came together! 🥰 And it was very entertaining seeing others guess my costume lmao. I’m glad I tried a bit on a budget. :) In hindsight I could have gotten bigger wings but I wasn’t looking to buy too much I wouldn’t use again lol. I also like how compact these were!

Also I’m grateful I won my work’s costume contest!! 🙏🏼 Wanted to share here as well. I really value self expression and trying my best, and hopefully this brings a smile to someone’s face. Amidst all my anxiety and self-doubt, this helps me be brave. Thanks for reading! :) Happy Halloween!",excited,Happy
"Today, after 4 years, I celebrated my first birthday sober.  Honestly, I didn’t think I would make it here. It’ll be a full year of sobriety in a couple weeks, which is probably the best birthday gift I’ve given myself. This is definitely a milestone that’s helped me become a little more confident.

I appealed but they denied me, and I went to community college for the next 4 years, since I primarily worked full time.

"After experiencing debilitating symptoms for months on end, I was finally set free and healing from carbon monoxide poisoning.  Since Dec of 23, I have been experiencing dehabilitating symptoms that left me feeling disabled and non-functional for months with no signs of improvement or resolution. I suffered from episodes of delirium, seizures, cognitive impairment, heart problems, confusion, memory loss, mood swings, disorientation, paranoia, head pressure, dissociation, weakness, fatigue, difficulty breathing, dizziness, akathisia and the list goes on. I ended up hospitalized for mental health reasons many times.
 
I have talked to nurses, doctors, paramedics, crisis lines, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists for months on end and my symptoms were always blamed on mental health, anemia, seizures and even benzo withdrawals…but I knew something was wrong. I finally got an mri scheduled.

I want to thank the first responders who showed up to my house and found the source of my distress and for airing out and bringing all the carbon monoxide levels out of my home. All the nurses and hospital staff who took care of me in the emergency room while I was undergoing oxygen therapy and for checking in on me often. I also want to thank the brilliant ER doctor who nursed me back to health and saved my life.

Today is the first day where I don’t feel lightheaded, confused, and disoriented, and it feels amazing and a blessing to be alive to see another day.

To anyone else struggling with their health, please keep advocating for yourself, keep bringing up your symptoms. I was advocating for 8 months before I found the source of my distress.

I hope I can recover from the neurological deficits and long-term effects. 

Just wanted to share!

"The universe was screaming at me and this man to be together, 5 years later we’re married for 4 years with two kids My now husband and I met senior year of college, just 3 months before graduation. He had a job in another state, I had another semester to complete and a job lined up on the other side of the country. Neither of us knew who each other were, and didn’t even realize we were in the same major, in the same classes, seated in the same row, with mutual friends. On top of this we lived ACROSS THE STREET from each other. We were both just keeping our heads down for the last bit of school and therefore oblivious to each other. Both out of very toxic relationships, not looking for anything, just trying to finish school and get to our jobs. We met, and sparks flew. We still moved where jobs were, started dating long distance, and 7 months in we were engaged, two months later we eloped in a courthouse, and now we have lived all over the country together and grown our family to include two beautiful children and two dogs. Call it fate, god, or dumb luck, but something was screaming at us to get together I believe, we had too much in common in such close proximity for something not to have been involved, and we’re forever thankful",excited,Happy

"I can’t believe it, I paid off my credit debt!!  I(33F) was floundering with $25k credit debt after my breakup, after moving to a new state for my ex. I was very alone and struggling to make my minimum payments. I met a wonderful friend who had bought a house and let me move in a year ago rent free, (I just do all the chores and take care of all the animals when she needs to travel for work or anything) and I just made my final payment on my accounts. I was going to be paying that shit for like THIRTY YEARS. I was going to be drowning forever. I’m free!! 

I talked to my friend afterwards, and suggested I start paying rent, and she just waved me off and said to start saving for a down payment for my own place. 

I don’t know what I did to deserve this. We met at a bar, I just gave her a couple rides to the hospital when she needed it and helped her when her tire had popped on the road. She’s giving me a new lease on life 🥹

I make her brownies all the time and make sure her soda stream is ready with plenty of bottles of water and make sure she has a breakfast sandwiches ready. She jokes and calls me her wife and says I’m gonna make my boyfriend a very happy man someday 🤣🤣",excited,Happy
" I hit over 50k monthly listeners in Spotify in under 2 years as a fully independent artist!! Most people didn’t believe I could do it…and even I doubted myself and wanted to give up many times, but I’m really glad I didn’t! :) 2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)

I am now a Junior with a 3.6 GPA in the Bachelor’s of science in the construction management program.

"I finally got my first kiss at 28 years old and felt capable of love It's probably strange as a girl. I'm not ugly, by all means, but I'm also not a super model. I'm actually very fit and actually I have been asked why I'm still single. I do have some mental barrier that somehow prevents me from making connection with other people. It's dam difficult to make friend and I can't be vulnerable enough, so I always come off as guarded, distanced, and stand-offish.

Then I met this guy on a dating app. Yes, it's not ideal. But I was bored and this summer had been bleak for me. For some reason, on that first date I felt comfortable with him that I no longer felt a kind of inhibition - the feeling of fear that I usually had that prompted me to keep my distance. I was willing to hold hands and when he mentioned kiss, I responded by standing on my toes first and he got the hint.

But honestly, I didn't feel anything. It wasn't like sparks and fireworks like mentioned in some novels. But I didn't feel disgusted too. I was terrible for sure. But we went on and made out, and only then I realised how comfortable kissing someone can be. Maybe I was slow at processing it, but only after he drove me home that I started to reel in the good feeling while laying on my bed.

For long I had thought I would end up being single and I would better off not having any relationship. Coming from a broken family and I have seen a lot of suffering caused by relationships and how stupid and weak someone can be when they are involved with someone, I have associated relationships with pain and it shaped me into a closed-off person. But after that, for the first time I start to feel some sliver of hope that maybe I'm still capable of feeling and sharing love or at least build an intimate connection with someone.",excited,Happy
"Fought back against depression and reclaimed my house I lost control of my house several years ago when a chronic illness really magnified my depression.  It just kept spiraling and getting more out of control.  I would just look at the overwhelming mess and clutter and shut down.   I would keep certain common rooms together in case people came inside, but in all the other rooms it was a full on hoard.   Today, I just watched a giant 15 yard dumpster get taken away from my driveway.  I rented it a week ago and filled it to the brim.  Cleaned out my garage, basement, bedroom - all my secret shame spots.  All of my dishes are washed.  The floors, tubs, and toilets are cleaned.  Every room is organized.  Even pulled the weeds.  I feel so hopeful in a way I haven't felt in years.  I'm so happy right now I'm crying while I type this.  And it's motivating me to keep doing the things I need to do continue being more healthy.  For the first time since I can remember I want to have people over and actually live in my house instead of just be in it.  ",excited,Happy

"I changed my bedsheets after a long time and moved on (from an ex), with the power of self love, becoming a happier and healthier me After around 2-3 months of being unable to change my bedsheets, I finally did today. You may wonder to yourself, what took so long? How could I stand being in all that dirt? And these are all questions you have a right to have. I had a partner I loved so so much sleeping with me in the old sheets. But today, he's only an ex. A faint echo of what once was. For months, I couldn't build the courage to change my bedsheets because I still felt him in it. Even though I have an OCD and I clean everything with care, even that wasn't enough for me to push through it. I would clean the room and the house so many times, A-Z, but then I saw my sheets and I just couldn't get myself to touch it. My family also kept asking when I'll change it, but I always said ""soon"". I felt like I just couldn't let go. But these past months I've also been recovering. I have been rebuilding my confidence, and the self love I once had. With the help of my family and friends (thank you so much! I love all of you! 💖) I overcame this too. It might seem silly, but changing these sheets was the final thing I needed. This symbolizes the end of what we had, and me finally moving on. Finally cutting all those connections I've had in my memory to him. And I couldn't be happier that I took this step. This marks a great step forward in moving on and being a better, happier me. So r/happy , this is my silly little story for today. I finally feel more free. Free from his grip, that thing in my mind that kept me down at night. And this makes me happy, and proud. I feel like I'm becoming myself once again. ",excited,Happy

I never tell him so he could say it back to me, but I was very happy to hear it. And last night we’re spending time together doing things and he said I was so incredibly sexy. I told him he was making me feel sexy. I felt very wanted and very desired and he’s not as expressive, but he’s becoming more expressive every day. I am so in love with this man. Even on our bad days. He such an incredible guy. Just yesterday I just felt a little more special than usual. He’s pretty good at making me feel important every day and loved.

"Toddler Randomly Adopts My Mom at a Rest Stop On our way home from a lil road trip today, my family and I stopped at a service station to stretch and take a break. While my mom and I were waiting for my dad near the entrance, she noticed this adorable toddler (maybe 1–2 years old) and gave a little wave and said hi.

This kid was so cute—big eyes, total lack of self-preservation lmao- and out of nowhere, she just runs at my mom with her arms up like she’s known her forever. My mom instinctively picks her up and checks with her parents and they’re just like, “I think it’s ok, it looks like she loves you!” Meanwhile, this tiny koala of a child clings to my mom and gives her this little nod like, yeah, you’re my person now.

It was the most unexpectedly wholesome thing. My mom was so touched—it’s amazing how a moment of pure, innocent connection like that can make you feel so appreciated.

Just wanted to share this sweet little experience on a day of gratitude. Happy Thanksgiving, y’all! ",excited,Happy

Afterwards all day today I've had this massive grin on my face and i genuinely could not thinking about it to the point i can't sleep.

"My little sibling is finally out of the ICU after open heart surgery, things are looking good They're technically not my sibling, they're my cousin, but they grew up mostly with us and have in the past told me they even saw me as a parental figure at some point, they've had a tough life and they're only 15.

They were born with a heart defect and have needed this surgery for a really long time. Unfortunately there's been so much neglect in their life previously and complicated custody battles, the people actually taking care of them had no legal right to make any medical decisions (grandparents even tried to adopt them but they couldn't win the case), so everything kept getting postponed. Well, they had a mental health crisis earlier this year and had to go to a mental institution for some time, as part of the procedures they had many medical tests done during their stay there. So finally when everyone saw how serious their condition was that sped things up.

A few months later and they finally called us to let us know they had a date for the surgery. It was supposed to be done with a catheter through a small incision under their arm, but just less than an hour before they went into the OR we were told it'd have to be open heart and not much more info. They said it'd last 3 to 4 hours but it lasted 6 and they also ended up having to insert a pacemaker too. They said it'd be 2 to 3 hours for them to wake up from the anesthesia but it took over 12 hours. We were all so worried, they were intubated cause they couldn't breathe on their own, so many IVs and things and we had so little information.

But yesterday they finally moved them from the ICU to intermediate care, and today they're in a regular recovery room. They're fully conscious, speaking, walking, making jokes, and grateful for this new chance at life... The doctors removed the pacemaker and say they'll be in good enough shape to be discharged in one or two days.

I can't imagine how scary it must be to go through all of that, especially being just 15 years old. I admire their courage so much and I'm so happy that after such a long wait they finally got the lifesaving surgery they needed. It'll be a long road to recovery after this, but they have a loving family now that'll always be there for them. I can't wait for them to be home again and to give them back the gigantic plushie they left under my care so they can hug it again :)",excited,Happy

"Found my person after 16 years of being single I had a traumatic childhood, and I've worked really, really hard to heal from that. I was in therapy for 15 years, and then my growth really accelerated after starting a class. After 16 years of being single, I finally found my person.

He is SO supportive, and so sweet. We have a ton of fun together. We're growing together. 1 feel such a strong bond with him. He's helping me in more ways than he knows, and he tells me I'm helping him a lot, too.

My friends are either in bad relationships no relationships, or they've been in their relationships for many years. I don't want to make anyone feel bad by saying how great my relationship is when theirs isn't, and I feel like some of my friends in long term relationships might be bored by it. So l'm posting here.

I just can't express how wonderful it feels to finally have an intimate connection with somebody who treats me so well. I also feel like I really deserve it, because l've worked so hard (and waited for so long) to be a healthy enough person to have a healthy relationship

Chip your pets! Our lost cat found after 16 months  16 months ago one of our cats got out of the house. Last week we got a call from a local vet that she had been located. She was only half a mile away. A family moved into a house in September and the kids started taking care of her as an outdoor pet. Eventually their mom got ahold of her and took her in to get scanned and now she’s home. Thought this was worth sharing.

"My partner always says “good work!” when I get our child to sleep and it makes me feel so appreciated ☺️ 
We have a one year old daughter, she has always struggled with sleep.

Every time I share with my partner that I’ve successfully helped her fall asleep, wether it be via messenger (often a picture her sleeping) or in person, he says “good work!”, often with emojis accompanying it.

He means it. I love it. It feels so good.

I love that even tho it’s something I do 2-10 times a day, for a year now, he still feels it’s worthwhile to acknowledge it and complement me for doing good work.

There are countless other ways he makes me feel appreciated, adored, loved and my work acknowledged 🥰 but just felt like posting about how this little sentence does so much. ",excited,Happy

I use that to try to, well not MINIMIZE the insecurity but to draw the attention to the fact that it isn't a disfigurement, it isn't unattractive, and it isn't anything to me and I could honestly care less except for the fact it causes him pain. I never knew how it made him feel when I did this, never knew if it was helpful, I honestly haven't known if he liked that answer or not..

Well 5 days ago I popped a pimple on my nose. I know you're probably not supposed to do that, that was really stupid of me, but today, 5 days later that spot is still sore and red. I don't like looking at pictures of myself these past few days (which...happens quite a bit unfortunately,  because my bf and I are long distance and it's one of the few ways we can really see each other) because I can't seem to look beyond the red spot on my nose. 

I myself have never really struggled with acne, so it's weird to me. I only ever have very mild breakouts along my hairline and around my nose, usually right before I start my monthly cycle. Whenever I do have breakouts I can usually move past them, it's only when they're noticable for 3 days or so that they start to bother me. 

So...today, my bf asked if he could see me (a picture). I told him no, and he asked why, and asked if I'm not feeling pretty right now, and I said yeah, that was it. I started feeling bad for saying no and like I was being silly and selfish, so I sent him a picture. He told me I was adorable and gorgeous, and asked why I wasn't feeling pretty so I told him. 

His reply? 

""I love you
And it honestly isn't that bad 🫂
Does it hurt?""

That simple question, ""Does it hurt?"" made me soooo happy! I felt really happy because it's such a simple question, effectively readjusts the focus, and it told me that he thought it has been helpful when I use it and that he PAYS ATTENTION and REMEMBERS such a small thing! (I've only used it 2-5 times in the span of a year because that's about how much he's voiced his feelings about his acne). I know it's really small lol but I felt seen, and tbh that helped a lot. I love him so much, he does so much to make me feel precious and important,  and he honestly is my safe place. He is my favorite person, the most handsome, sweet, wholesome, precious guy and i am always finding new ways to appreciate him.",excited,Happy
"Sometimes little gestures can brighten someone’s day. Last year I started putting snacks and drinks on my porch for delivery drivers. It’s been fun, selecting the different snack options and seeing the smiles on their faces as a select a snack or grab a bottle of water.

"Matched with my crush after 5 years and we hit it off About 5 years ago a new colleague came into my work, and since we were both the same age in a company of mostly older ladies and gentlemen we immediately hit it off and spent a lot of time together over the next year. I definitely developed a crush. She however was in a relationship anyway, even if that wasn't running as smoothly as it could have, from what I gathered.

However she left after a year, Covid struck and I've never heard from her again. She didn't have any social media and we didn't exchange phone numbers.

Fast forward to the present, I just got out of a long term relationship myself, and suddenly see her on a dating app. We matched and immediately went for coffee.

It was one of the best feelings ever. To see a person you thought you'd never see again. I was smiling the whole time. I'm not having any big time fantasies like ""that's it, we're gonna spent our lives together"", I was just enjoying reuniting with someone I cared about in the past, and seeing where it takes us.

The date went well and we're planning the next. Feels like I’m in a dream.",excited,Happy
"The universe has gifted me an early birthday present, and in return I have chosen my last day at work I have wanted to leave my job for a while, and always made an excuse to stay. Then in January, I went back to school and decided to work less hours. 

A few weeks ago I was offered work study, so I applied for a position, and last week was hired. It is a fully remote position after training, and will be active until I graduate. 

Yesterday, I was notified that I was awarded multiple scholarships for school, and my entire tuition is covered. So, this morning I finally wrote my letter of resignation, and chose my official last day at my job.

"I am officially debt free for the first time in my life Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. ",excited,Happy
"4 years no contact with friends and they waited for me 2020 pandemic. Lockdown era. Omfg we’re all gonna die era. My mental health could NOT cope with 2020 so I self-isolated (lockdown wasnt enough for me apparently) from EVERYONE. I didn’t return texts or calls or anything. I was 21 yrs old (just an fyi).

This group of friends was my OG group. Elementary to high school to college. It was always us against the world. We knew everything about each other, we all loved each other.

By 2022, my mental health was getting better and i reached out to other friends. Problem was, after reaching out to other friends, I still self isolate so i’d be gone for a month or two. No online presence. Nothing. So, I didn’t contact my OG group cuz they didn’t deserve to be ghosted (not that my other friends deserved it, I just didn’t want to hurt more people).

My OG group kept reaching out to me for 4 years. They left me messages. Sent me gifts. Even talked to my boyfriend asking how I was. I felt honored that they did all this but I also felt immense guilt. I still wasn’t ready to face them and because of that, they were getting hurt. I spent a lot of time crafting messages for them. I could never send them. I was chicken af.

BY SOME MIRACLE, i went to a cafe yesterday to get something for my dad and then i saw ONE OF MY FRIENDS. Lets call her CC. We locked eyes and we hugged! We cried and CC just accepted me. She wholeheartedly accepted me and I was just so thankful for the chance meeting. She said that everyone was waiting for me and all i needed to do was send them a message. There was no anger no resentment. There was just love, acceptance, and understanding. CC told me she missed me. 

I had to leave cuz I was with my disabled dad but when I got home, I messaged all of them and they just accepted me with open arms and all. I don’t know what I did to deserve all this love?? I am still reeling from all this. It doesn’t seem real. They’re the best people and I feel blessed that they accepted me wholeheartedly. Jeez. They waited for me. I still can’t believe it. 

I’m going to meet all of them again on July 7. I missed them and it feels good to know that they missed me??? They missed me. Jeez. I still can’t believe it. I thought i would never see them again or talk to them. 


TLDR: 4 years no contact with OG group. Chance meeting with one of my friends in the OG group helped me gather the courage to contact them. They all accepted me with open arms, love, and acceptance. We’re seeing each other soon on July 7. ",excited,Happy
"I just presented my work with Doctors Without Borders to my CEO and entire company, overcoming the panic attacks that I’ve been having for over a year ❤️🔥 Hey all, I work for an agency that does work for some major nonprofits, one being DWB. 

I’ve been here for a while and had a panic attack early being at this company and have been completely stuck and living in fear of presenting ever since then (more than a year). 

I love my job and my work, but I’ve been so nervous that doing better would lead to more presentations and it’s been some of the roughest times of my life and career. I couldn’t present a single slide without freezing and feeling like I was going to die or my heart would beat out of my chest. 

I’ve been doing intense trauma therapy ever since that initial panic attack and CHOSE to present today when I could have said no. 

BUT I DID 🔥

I was able to overcome the panic and present my work with power and pride. I think this is the largest turning point in my career, and I couldn’t be happier. 

I just needed to tell someone, because this has been the largest, most invisible struggle of my life without exception. 

And I see the light at the end of the tunnel, I overcame the panic this time I can do it again.

"My wife makes me so happy, like all the time, I'm so lucky for having her in my life  So, basically me and my wife met on Instagram ( I found her profile, liked some posts, even replied and made fun of some screenshots of her MW2 plays ). 
  Some days later, she followed me on IG, we engaged on some conversations about games, tattoos, etc. Kept talking, not only thought text, but on video too, spent like 5 hours talking nonstop.
  Then we became a couple( long distance ) at the start, till we planned meeting IRL, we lived in different cities. The day finally came, we met IRL, she lived with her parents and brother at the time.
  Now, after 6 months, almost 7, we are living together in ""our"" apartment, we have a cat and 2 squirrels.

  The thing is, she probably doesn't even know, she makes me so happy, like, extremely and genuinely happy, I've never been this happy on my entire life, we are planning to get married on the next 1 or 2 years. I'm so lucky to have her.

Edit: if this isn't the best subreddit to post, I apologize. And sorry for any grammatical mistakes, English isn't my native language.

EDIT 6m later: a few weeks after posting this, she broke up with me, saying that I never had money to buy her things like cigarettes, whiskey and other things that aren't that essential, since I was the only one working from Monday to Sunday.

"Lovely coincidental text message from my partner today At 9:56 am today my boyfriend (m23) of 4 years and I (f21) both randomly  texted each other ""I love you ❤️"" while we were apart and it just made me smile.

"Asked my fav prof to get a drink and she said yes!! Background: I love love love my prof and I’ve had her for multiple classes. We have a slightly deeper bond than teacher student because she has been so academically, professionally, and emotionally supportive of me. She got me out of a manipulative/disrespectful work environment and got me a new job and has given me so many networking names (which I’ve used). She’s used so much of her personal time to talk with me and to listen, and to help me with life and school. I could go on and on about the things she’s done for me. 

Despite being in a good standing with her, I still get nervous around her because I admire her. Our class is ending next week and my friends and I wanted to celebrate XXX’s graduation. I have wanted to get to know my prof outside of school but never acted on it in case I’d have her again but I have officially gone through the highest level she teaches. So to not have it be a weird one on one or to cross boundaries, I wanted to ask her if she would get a drink with us to celebrate graduation. It went like this:

“Our class is going out for a drink on Monday to celebrate XXX’s graduation, will you come with us? Or coffee if you don’t-“ “let me see” 

She said yes and she put it in her calendar and I’m so happy and excited! I love her! And she cut me off to reassure me that she wanted to and I know that was intentional because she knows me so well. And she said “thanks for inviting me!” Stop she’s the star of the show, we adore her!


Learned: all you have to do is ask! I’m so so excited!

"Tomorrow makes 9 months of alcohol sobriety! Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

"Today I am the luckiest guy in the world.  This last weekend was truly special. My partner met my family for the first time, and it couldn’t have gone better. Everyone loved her and approved of her.

I took a walk today and in a quiet moment of reflection, I realized that I’m super lucky. I have everything I’ve ever wanted in my life. I’m so grateful for all of it. Here are just a few things:

* My partner: We communicate so well and are aligned on every level—emotionally, mentally, and in our values. We’ve never fought, because we handle conflicts with such openness and respect for each other. I didn’t know relationships like this existed, and I feel incredibly lucky to have found her. She is the love of my life. 
* My work: My job pays well, is very secure, and gives me a great work/life balance. Being able to work remotely has changed my life. I'm one of the lucky ones that was positively impacted by Covid.
* My friends: I'm so grateful for my friends. I’m surrounded by people who genuinely care, lift me up, and inspire me to grow. I couldn’t ask for a better support system. They've always been there for me, and I hope to be the same for them.
* My home: I love where I live! My neighborhood is clean, safe, and has an amazing view that I get to wake up to every day. It’s a joy to host friends here and share great moments in a space that feels like a true home.
* My health: I’m taking better care of myself than ever before. My body is in the best shape it’s ever been, and I’m proud of the progress I’ve made.
* My car: This one is silly and superficial, but I love my car. It gives me such joy to drive it. The perfect blend of comfort, luxury, and performance. I used to think driving was just to go from point A to point B, but my car has taught me that you should also enjoy the journey.

I’ve had my share of setbacks and painful lessons, but today I’ve risen above it all. 

Life isn’t perfect, and I know nothing lasts forever. But for this brief moment in time, I am the luckiest person on this planet, and I want to share my gratitude with you all!

I wish you all the best life has to offer! <3 ",excited,Happy
"My mom’s boyfriend came back and has become my dad My mom first started dating this guy when I was about 9 or 10, right after my parent’s divorce. He moved in soon after, and we (My mom, brother, and I) lived with him for years. We moved a lot back then, and at one point him and my mom bought property together. This fell out pretty hard for them, causing a lot of strain on their relationship. He never got very close with myself or my brother, and eventually they broke up—leaving the house they built. Year or so later, my dad kicks me out of the house, I’m 14. I had officially lost all paternal figures in my life. Fast forward to now, about 3? ish months ago he and my mom got back together. Suddenly he was back in my life, and we started actually bonding. I struggle really hard with academics, but due to some life changes, I started doing a lot better. I recently got my report card from school and he was so proud of me keeping my grades up that he gave me $20, and put it up on the fridge. Just like a real dad should. The phrase “Not stepdad, dad who stepped up” might be considered corny but he really did do that for me. I’m proud to say I have a dad again. :)",excited,Happy

"My partner is so fucking amazing, I cannot believe how fucking lucky I am  He is so kind and loving and caring, always showing me how much he TRULY loves me. He CONSTANTLY showers me in compliments, tells me how pretty I am or how much he loves my random jokes and thoughts and how proud he is of me, even for the little things. 

Just recently I told him that I wanted to learn how to crochet and he was just as enthusiastic as me, telling me how amazing that would be and that he will support me while I'm trying a new skill and it just made me so happy and fuzzy inside. He just always takes the time to listen to what I'm passionate about and lets me rant about my hobbies and interests and gives his opinion to my ideas and just always makes sure I know that even though this may not be his interests, he loves and appreciates how much they mean to me. 

He also always pushes me to do things and literally is my main motivation to do things. Just because of him I manage to work on my paper with ease and even though it is a lot of work, him being with me and watching me while I do research or write something just as this very comforting feeling for me and just makes me so fucking happy. Afterwards, he will read what I wrote and give me advice, but also tell me that's it's amazing and how proud he is of me.

The amount of patience that this man has is astounding. I know that I'm someone who easily gets lost in my own thoughts and struggles with confidence and quite a few insecurities and yet he's always there to build me back up and tell me that's it's going to be okay. Even when I mess up and accidentally hurt him, he has NEVER given up on me, always believing in me improving on my mistakes and becoming a better person and partner (hopefully I really am improving). He's just so genuinely kind and loving and would do ANYTHING for me, just like I would do ANYTHING for him. 

He makes me so fucking happy every single god damn day and I SERIOUSLY cannot fucking WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT to marry him and spend the reat of my life with him. Before him, I didn't believe that the concept of ""the love of one's life"" existed, but I have changed my mind now. He TRULY is the one, I KNOW it and I just am so fucking lucky to call him my man. 

In case you're reading this C. I just wanted to tell you that I love you more than ANYTHING or ANYONE else COMBINED and you truly just make me so unbelievably fucking happy. I hope that I am at least able to make you feel just as loved as you make me feel every single god damn day. You TRULY are special and I love you with all that I own. I love you C. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️",excited,Happy

"Finally found something that works for my ADHD I have tried almost everything under the sun to manage my ADHD besides medication (personal preference) -books, therapies, courses, apps, schedules and timers, you name it. Basically I’ve been on a self help journey for over ten years and I finally found the thing that works for me -and it really was me making lemonade out of two lemons.

The first lemon was me deciding against my better judgment to download and pay for yet another app which left me feeling manipulated because the app promised I’d basically be able to live life normally, only to do a bait and switch AFTER I had given them my money where they asked for 8x the amount I just paid because “80% of users don’t stick with the app, so you need an ADHD coach.” 

I immediately requested my money back and they settled on giving me half back but this got me thinking. I remembered that before I started my self help journey I had always said that if I had a “life manager” I’d be able to do anything and everything. 

Lemon two is that me and my brother’s fiancé never really had a super close relationship because she can be a bit bossy. Y’all can probably see where I’m going with this. After the app disappointment, I scanned through the people I knew and looked for the bossiest person I know (actually my brother is the bossiest but he’s unstable so I didn’t want to f with that lol), I decided to ask her if she would be my virtual “body double” for some side cash. Basically she just receives my updates, sometimes with “proof” and she acknowledges it and gives me encouragement.

You guys. In just a few weeks I have been able to increase my business growth, work on my goals that I’ve been procrastinating on for years, be healthier than I’ve ever been by working out daily, and overall I’m just feeling like I’m so much happier and healthier and normal. I have a routine of 10 important things (excluding my daily to do list) and in three weeks I’ve only missed one day. 

I’m so happy and even my subconscious is noticing because I wake up from the most beautiful dreams. I literally had one the other day where I woke up and my first words to myself were “I can do ANYTHING.”

So, if you have ADHD and you’ve tried it all, maybe try asking someone to be your virtual body double. 10/10 recommend. 😊

**Edit to add what a body double is: Body doubling is a productivity strategy that can help people with ADHD focus and complete tasks by having someone else nearby while they work. The person being helped is called the ""body double"" and their role is to provide support and reduce distractions.

"My husband is with one of his oldest friends tonight in another state and I feel joy!  My husband had to travel this week for work to his hometown. This is one of the worst times he could have traveled for me, as I’m on call for a birth and we have kids. 

I encouraged him to reach out to one of his oldest friends there and make time to see him. I’ve only met this friend 2 times in the 20 years we’ve been together, but I know him through many other friends, my husband, and the kinship we felt upon meeting each time. 

My husband is with his friend tonight, and even though I’m dealing with the banal reality of parenting kids alone today, I’m so happy for my husband. I feel so excited for him to see this friend we haven’t seen in 4 years, and for him to reconnect with him. 

I would love to be there too, but I’m still feeling a bit of the excitement and joy he will feel. 

Anyway, I thought I’d share. It’s such a little  thing and I don’t even get to be a part of it, but I am so happy for my husband and our friend. I know my husband will come home reinvigorated and more alive from seeing his friend. 

Life is short and friendships you can hang onto are precious. They’ll both be turning 50 this year and his friend wasn’t supposed to make it to 30 due to getting a donated heart at 19. My husband was with him through that and friend is still kicking, kicking ass, and just a wonderful human. ",excited,Happy
"Why do I care so much about unhappy people? I’m starting to realize I always try to help people who seem unhappy. I do this with coworkers, random people, family members etc. I’m a person who’s always smiling and happy so perhaps that has something to do with it.

I’m trying to figure out how I can stop caring so much because not everyone wants to be helped or cheered up. ",excited,Happy

"I'm sure they took classes I would find difficult, but nothing makes me feel better about myself than having 3 doctors GROAN at my favorite subject I was in a PCP appointment to get my ambien refilled, my doctor had to get his attending physician and a psychology major that was still finishing their schooling, because zolpidem is a controlled substance. I am going back to school in January to finish my organic chemistry degree, which I mentioned to them. All THREE of these doctors groaned out loud and had this incredulous look on their faces, like, ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" and they all told me it was the worst subject they ever took. 

I didn't even know that would happen, I love chemistry and organic chemistry specifically, I have to get straight As in my next semester and after, I have a master's program to get into for pharmacology, and that is incredibly competitive. Anyway, to have 3 doctors groan at my favorite subject makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside, smart and capable and. Idk. I just REALLY needed to hear that because it reminds me that I CAN do this and i WILL do this. 

Thanks for indulging me, lol. ",excited,Happy
"I'm super proud of my niece that just graduated high school and she surprised me with something I had no idea about I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever.",excited,Happy
"I got called pretty for the first time ever yesterday! It may sound like a little thing, but I've only ever been called cute by past guys I have seen. I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but it feels a bit like throwing a dog a bone.

Yesterday I went on a first date with a guy I met on Tinder. We get on really well, have lots of interests in common. When he went to drive, nearly t-boned us straight away... But told me later it was because he was nervous to meet me... Because I was pretty 🥹

This just makes me feel the warm and fuzzies because I'm a bigger gal, and it's so nice to feel appreciated and seen!",excited,Happy
"I finally took charge of my mental health and received a diagnosis and medication. This is the first time I’ve felt like myself in years.  After years of suffering in silence like a total jabroni, I finally asked for help. I suffered throughout my entire teens with anxiety and depression. I began self medicating with alcohol and other drugs before developing a drinking problem in adulthood. This past month I got myself into counseling, group therapy, and began meeting with a psychiatrist. I finally gave up drinking and am now treating my anxiety and depression with medication. This is the first time I’ve felt like myself in years. I finally feel hopeful and optimistic about my life again. Just a few weeks ago I couldn’t see a way out and wanted to end it all. Please ask for help if you need it. It’s crazy how a little chemical imbalance can cloud your light. I am so grateful. ",excited,Happy

"I finally understand what it means to be in a good relationship  Little over a month ago I (30F) ended my three year relationship. I intended to be single for a long time and just enjoy life. I had wanted to end it for at least half a year, but I didn’t think I had anywhere to go to. So I felt stuck. That made it a big relief when I actually ended it.

There was one coworker (39M) that I had had feelings for for quite a while, but I didn’t think I stood any chance with him. Well, it turns out those feelings were actually mutual, but he had kept his distance because I was taken. He also hadn’t had a girlfriend before and was scared to mess up. Anyways, long story short: he came to my housewarming party and we got together. After about a week he told me he hadn’t had sex before us and I was surprised big time as it had felt so good. We did meet some difficulties but I had attributed that to us both being on the larger side.

Anyways, I’ve always been someone who wanted a lot of sex, had sex and then got disappointed because it didn’t feel as good as I was hoping. That has finally changed: we have the most mind blowing sex I have ever had. He has managed to give me an orgasm from just penetration, something I’d never thought I would get. And not just the sex is awesome, but also all the other stuff we do. We’ve gone on hikes, dates, will be going to the pool. I’m finally getting the more active life I’ve been longing for.

And the best part? We were a little nervous when we made it public, seeing as we work on the same unit of the hospital. The unit has two managers and both have been nothing but happy for us. Same with our coworkers and friends. I’ve never been in a relationship that felt this good and where I look forward to the future as much as now.",excited,Happy

"Today, my bf of 3 years helped me set up my porcelain dolls that I've collected since childhood, which now include some from his mother. I haven't been able to have them on display since I was 19 due to exes mishandling my belongings, stealing them or breaking them, on accident or on purpose, family going through my belongings while supposed to be in safe storage, niblings trying to steal my things when they came over, etc. Today, they are on proud display in my living room despite my bf thinking they're creepy, he knows I love them. He knows what they mean to me. He helped me get to a point I felt safe displaying my proud belongings again. (Ignore the wall color, we're repainting the entire house soon) Also, yes, the 2 gingers in the back do have missing eyes. The one in the green dress was bought that way, the one beside her in the red hat was missing an eye when bought and the other was loose, both were bought with one in mind that my sister had given me when I was a kid, a porcelain baby doll in a white and green frilly dress with red hair and no eyes, but my other sister got mad and broke her when I was 14, so I found the green dress in a thrift about 4 years later and knew I had to have her) Sorry for the long post but I'm just so happy that I'm finally safe enough to display my things again.

"This is the first time I've ever been satisfied/felt content with life. I'm 32 and I hit about rock bottom when I ended up living on the streets when I was 27. I'd say up until that point nothing had ever gone my way in life. Something changed though one day while I was out there, it was almost like the world itself actually got brighter. But whatever that change was, since then my life has gotten better and better every day albeit even if just a little bit. It was just kinda like a lightbulb went off and I suddenly had an epiphany and figured out how this whole living life thing works. And it's been great! I'm not in the best position in my life and I still have a lot of improvement to make, but I am light years ahead of where I was in my life before I had this life changing moment at 27. But I can say with confidence and certainty that this is truly the first time I've ever been happy in my life.",excited,Happy

"4 + inches of snow overnight and my dogs are in heaven.  Overnight we had a small snowstorm. Between 4 to 5 inches of wet, heavy snow was dumped on us. This made for an interesting drive home from work and some intense clearing the walks when I got home from work. My dogs, however, are in heaven. We did about 3 miles in this stuff and they played the entire time. I have to admit, this snow made everything beautiful. I told my wife that we may need to pick up a used snowmobile and really have fun.",excited,Happy
"Finally getting the help I need in a psych hospital  Finally opening up 

I've been in a psych hospital for a month now, currently outpatient, and things are getting better!

I received very bad news today.
usually I shut down and push everyone away when I'm sad & angry at myself. But today I didn't, I talked about it with a nurse and she really helped me, showed me a new skill and even made me laugh! 

The skill helped a ton and by the end I was laughing!

I am proud of myself for finally getting the help I need, finally opening up and just telling someone who can actually help me how I truly feel.

"Gave my first compliment to a random man today lol I'm female and it's relatively easy to tell a strange woman that you like her hair or dress, but I've always held back on saying anything similar to a guy even though I have had men ask me where I got my boots from etc. Idkw, maybe because the Internet acts like you can't say anything to guys without them taking it a sign of interest, and who knows maybe if I wasn't an ugly scruffy mess the experience would have been different 🤷‍♀️

But anyway while I was doing some shopping just now I saw a guy wearing a Christmas garfield top so I said I like your hoodie- I know it would be hard for even the biggest horndog to get anything other than a harmless genuine compliment from that, unless followed up by ""it really hugs your muscles "" or ""shows off your broad shoulders"" 🤣
But I followed up with you don't see garfield that often, he said thank you and we went our separate ways lol.

I've often read about how men rarely get a compliment, so I hope on this world kindness day I brought him a little happiness ",excited,Happy

"Overcame my Eating Disorder at 24 and now I’m finally able to enjoy life Two years ago I had a severe eating disorder, and ended up dropping out of my second attempt at a Master’s Degree to go to a residential treatment center.

I’ve been a bit hesitant to post about this on Reddit because of some fat phobia that pervades certain subreddits but here goes-

I used to base my value on how much money I could make, who I was connected to, and how thin and attractive I was.

A year of therapy has helped me see that my worth lies completely separately to how I look. My body is a tool to enjoy life and connect with others.

I went from mentally ill at a top-10 technological school to bartending with little to my name besides the community I surround myself with!

I now invest my time and energy in a variety of interests. I go birding twice a week to get fresh air and enjoy nature / see more of the countryside than I’ve ever seen before!

I just joined a guild for people that spin wool. I plan to raise a sheep on my parent’s farm, shear it, wash the wool myself, card and spin the wool, dye it with plants I’ve collected from my garden, and make it into a garment!

I bartend currently, and I’ve been nominated for awards / gotten google reviews specifically calling out how kind I am.

I babysit my cousins and formed a really strong bond with family members young and old.

I still live with my parents, and I’ve been fortunate enough and so so privileged to stay with them. They’re going to fund my life for a few months so I can quit working and focus on studying video game design so I can move into something I love!

Speaking of, I’ve reconnected with old friends and spent 40+ hours on the phone with them just through video games!

I might be a bit chubby now, and I definitely didn’t achieve any of the great jobs or accolades I yearned for when I was younger, but I’ve also never been happier with life.",excited,Happy

"I wish everyone the best. Today I cried out of happiness. Everything will be okay. To all those suffering is silence please read.  I’m 23. I grew up in deprived conditions surrounded by rich extended family members while my mom and dad were struggling, my father was practically absent. My mother raised us single. All I’d seen was chaos, stabbings, guns, back chatting, cheating, lying, I was a victim of racism for secondary, I fought every day for 5 years against other students, I went to college same thing, I didn’t do my GCSE because of being in a coma during that time after suffering head trauma. Lost my dream career of medicine after getting nothing for that period. I had 2 exes that I tried to dearly care for after seeing my mother suffer but apparently it was not enough, my first once used me so much, and most recent once hurt the most to the point of thinking should I end reality as she was becoming a dentist and left me because I was perfect but I wasn’t going to be on the same level as her career path. , I was suffering with extreme anxiety and depression, I decided enough was enough and I’m gonna focus on me.

I got onto anxiety medication. It’s been 4 weeks to date and tonight I cried passionately, not because of being upset, not out of fear, not out of feeling a failure. But because I realised everything will be okay, I sobbed for a good 30 mins releasing that feeling, and I just wanted to let everyone know that it can be good, you’ve got to seek help from the people you can genuinely rely on. 

I’ve got onto a course that may be able to take me onto pharmacy, my finances are enough for me, my mother is happy. My father is okay with me. My family are getting happy, we are getting more stable.  
 

I am here for advice if anyone needs it. 

F*** my ex, f*** all those people who doubted me, f*** all those who try to use me.

I’m back on my stride. ",excited,Happy

I burned my arm making us dinner and he came running to put it under cold water and gave the burn lots of kisses and it made me tear up, I felt really overwhelmed by the care. 

For context as to why this sticks out to me; my dad used to scream at me for making any mistakes in the kitchen, even if I got a cut or something. I barely make an emotional reaction to getting hurt anymore and all I said was “Ouch..” before he came over. It was so sweet and it feels like he’s healing a part of me..",excited,Happy

"I think after 9 years of zero social life I might have finally beaten my social anxiety yesterday? So I've had crippling social anxiety much of my life, it was particularly worsened when I moved country, and then made even worse when I went through a really bad drug addiction. When I got clean, I was just so terrified of people I stopped interacting entirely, I locked myself up at home since 2015, and ever since then I've had no social life at all, other than online. I'm 31 and the last time I'd been social was when I was 22. Felt like I lost a decade of my life. 

Last year was rough. I'd fallen back into drugs and ended up experiencing a year long episode of psychosis even after getting clean in April '23. I had to be on antipsychotics for a while (now weened off with my psych's permission as the psychosis is gone since March!). But my psychotic episode thankfully also led to me starting therapy, which may now have completely changed my life forever.

I started doing exposure therapy by going on short walks, then longer walks, then spending hours a day walking around town, going to shops etc. But I couldn't bring myself to really do much more than that. Until two days ago.

I was sitting on a bench in the shade because it was too hot, and a stranger sat next to me. He lit a cigarette and I lit one too and we started chatting about life. Ended up splitting some beers I'd originally bought to take home, and having a two hour conversation with this stranger. Aside from my therapist, that was the first social interaction I'd had IRL since 2019. 

Then yesterday, feeling more confident after my interaction, I went to a restaurant alone for the very first time in a decade, and then that boosted my confidence so afterwards I did what I've been dying to do for years.. I went to a bar for the first time since I was 22! 

I made some friends there, and even discovered that they know a lot of my old friends, so they told one of them I was there and so not only did I make some new awesome friends but I ran into one of my old best friends for the first time since 2015. I had an awesome night and great conversations, lots of laughs. I was also very open about my anxiety and everyone was super understanding and positive about it. 

All these years locked up in my house wanting to socialise but feeling completely paralysed by fear, but.. I think I've done it? I think I've beaten my social anxiety. I think I've made friends? I think I may just have a social life again after 9 years of my life were spent hidden away alone in fear. 

Since I don't have a ton of friends due to my anxiety I didn't really have many people I could share this with, so that's why I'm posting it here. I just feel so elated to have finally conquered something that was ruining my life for so long. If any of you are struggling with similar anxiety, know that you can absolutely get out there and beat it. I HIGHLY recommend therapy, and especially exposure therapy! Gradual exposure makes things so much easier.

Anyway that's my little story, sorry if it's a little long or rambly, thank you if you decided to read through it or leave a comment. Wishing you all a fantastic day. 💗",excited,Happy

"Losing nearly 50lbs is incredible for me! Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey.",excited,Happy

"It's my birthday today and I'm in a much better place now It's my birthday today and I'm officially 28 years old.

I'm living in a much better place now and I've finally cut all the toxic people out of my life. I've stopped drinking and I'm 8 months sober and in my 28 years of life these are the most important lessons I've learned:

"My boyfriend and I just had the most mature loving conversation about the future we want together! I’m on cloud 9! I’m 33 now and after four serious long term relationship fails, I’m with a partner who isn’t afraid to have big conversations about our future together. We’re going to get married, we want to buy a house together and maybe adopt a child or two someday! I’m so used to those kinds of conversations being heavily avoided by whomever I was with in the past, it feels so…normal to be able to talk about it. We both work hard in our job fields and coming together we really have a chance at a comfortable happy life together. 

On top of that, this is my first partner that loves Christmas! He’s been excitedly looking into a gift for me, I haven’t gotten a Christmas present from a partner in such a long time! I’m going to spoil him myself, I’ve got some cool ideas I think he’d love. My past partners were so bah humbug about the holidays and it was really disheartening for me at the time because I grew up loving the holiday regardless of not being very religious. 

My childhood and early 20s was riddled with trauma and I really didn’t believe anyone would find me worthy of this kind of love and life. ",excited,Happy
"We were approved for the forever home!!!! SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you.

"My child called him dad for the first time I have an almost ten year old child with learning disabilities. Their biological father isn't physically around and hasn't been for years, this doesn't negatively affect us in anyway way. Sometimes things just aren't meant to be and life goes on. 

I'm currently engaged to a man who's a majorly positive impact on our lives. He has his faults, as all people do, but he's improved our lives in an immeasurable amount. 

The other day, my child went outside to play with some neighbor kids who came to invite him outside. We turned on the ring camera app just to keep an ear out as we were working on some things inside. The kids that came over rarely cause any ruckus so a non issue. 

My kid had shown them the pumpkins were picked that day and told them that the pumpkin my fiance had picked out was ""my dad's pumpkin."" I cried a bit. 

I was never going to enforce having them call  my fiance dad or really anything. They made the connection on their own without anyone pushing for it and it's the sweetest thing ever. ",excited,Happy

"I successfully took a pill and it went great! Ok so, for context, I’m 25 years old and I’ve struggled to take pills basically my whole life, lol. I know, I know, “you’re an adult and you still can’t take pills?” — it’s true! My body just finds every way to find the pill no matter how “hidden” it is, and reject it.

I’ve tried every popular method people have suggested whether it’s the pop/water bottle method, the “stick it way back”, the “take it like a shot”, swallow with your head down, etc. etc. and it’s just… never worked. I managed to get the pop bottle method to work once but it honestly felt more like a fluke, and either way I was sitting there trying to get a pill to go down for a solid 30 minutes 😭

Essentially, I tend to just avoid pills as much as I can and opt for liquid options instead, even if they don’t taste great, because at least I can swallow and then wash most things down. 

But just yesterday, I was (finally) diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed meds, and to my expectation (and chagrin), the Strattera Rx comes in little capsule pill form. The good thing is, I can take them with food, and in fact it’s directed that I do so.

I’m looking for lunch today after my work shift, and I pass by some cheese cubes and I go “Well. I love cheese, and they’re bite sized… maybe I can try something with those?” & pick up a bag. Practiced with some Tic-Tacs I also bought, and they worked like a charm! 

Y’all have no idea how much relief and joy that brought me, to NOT have to struggle with pills* anymore 😭💕
Anyways, as silly of an “issue” as it is, i’m glad that I found a solution that works for me! I’m hoping that this medication also works for me too lol but today’s my first day of taking it, so we’ll see.",excited,Happy
"I gave out full-size bars again this year This is the third year in a row I’ve done this. We’re starting to get a reputation. I’m pretty sure I heard a kid exclaim “We have to go here, this is the best house in the neighborhood!” I loved seeing and hearing the kids’ reactions. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of that. Many mistakenly called them king-sized bars; I guess compared to the mini ones they look pretty big. There’s nothing better than seeing a kid’s eyes bug out when you give them a full-size Snickers or M&Ms. We had well over 200 trick or treaters this year and I still had to give some kids the backup candy. I’ll make sure to be prepared next year for at least 250. I’ve decided to leave work an hour early next year, to have more time for taking my own kids trick or treating and to get back home in time to catch more of the younger trick or treaters.

I can’t believe it’s been a whole year. Last year, Halloween came just a few weeks after my world was shattered and I was just trying to take it one day at a time. I’ve been slowly glueing and taping it back together this past year. My life is still not great but it’s a lot better than where I was and getting better as time goes on. Giving out full-size bars is honestly one of the highlights of my year, I just love seeing how happy it makes the kids. I also don’t mind the teenagers, I’d guesstimate about half of my trick or treaters were 13+. Childhood is so short, I’m more than OK with letting them try to hold onto it a little longer. My own kids are growing so quickly, I’m afraid to blink.

I’ll update you next year with my new numbers. Until then, be kind to one another and treat yourself to the full-size bar every once in awhile.",excited,Happy

"Life was well, but my friend's birthday party made me realize that my life is actually GREAT. *(Not too sure if this is technically on topic? but i'd thought i'd share because i'm really proud of myself.)*

My whole life I have struggled with suicidal ideation, and I used to think I wouldn't make it past high-school or past turning 18 for whatever reason. My childhood wasn't the most rough, but it was surely heavy on the emotional department, and for a long time I felt hopeless.

Not anymore.

Today my dad took me to a friend's birthday party, and as he was driving me to the place, I, for the first time, actually sat and thought about how great my life is. How excited I was to see my friends, to have fun, to be goofy and young, to attend my friend's future birthday parties, to be alive.

The sun was blasting, the sky was the most beautiful shade of blue I had ever seen, the wind flew through my hair and cooled down my face, the water was the most soothing i've ever felt it be, and I had the most fun I've had in *forever*. I'm tearing up just thinking about it. I don't know if this comes from just missing my friends and finally seeing them after a long time, but I think today was one of the happiest days of my life, and it is the first time in my life where I felt like I *NEED* to be there for the future. I need to see my friends get married, have families, getting their degrees, getting better, getting clean, getting ready for dates, getting drunk and having fun out at night, getting old with them. I'm so grateful I'm so far removed from the past I've come to known my whole life to the point where being in a steaming hot car in the middle of the day didn't turn into a boring, troublesome situation, but it turned into a moment of thanking. The universe for putting me here, my friend's parents for bringing them to me, and myself for being me.

So yeah, I never really believed in the whole ""It gets better"" sentiment, but I think the moment came for me. It finally got better. For me, and for little me as well.

Long post lol really sorry, just really proud of myself and needed to write it down. Thanks for reading.",excited,Happy

My tub faucet handles were leaking. I’ve been stalling a little bit on fixing them, out of insecurity. Today I went and bought some wrenches from my local hardware store, went home and pulled apart the pieces. Brought them into the hardware store to see if they had the new washers I needed. The store owner told me he was impressed with how I got the pieces apart by myself, then gave me the washers for free!

I went home and had them both fixed in 10 minutes. Couldn’t be prouder of myself and it’s been a great lesson in giving myself more credit for what I can be capable of!",excited,Happy
"A boba tip reminded me of how much I love people So today I was at the mall with my friends and got boba. I tipped the cashier a dollar (small, I know, but I don't really get allowance and I don't have a job). I have anxiety speaking/interacting with adults so it was hard for me to make eye contact, but I could hear the surprise when he said thank you. Maybe because I look like I'm 10 and most 10 year olds probably don't tip (I'm not, but). It made me happy that I could give something.

"I am so happy, because I got a boyfriend, despite my disabilities! Honestly, I never thought I'd get a boyfriend! I am disabled, and I use a walker most of the time and a wheelchair sometimes. I am also neurodivergent, so I can be a bit weird around people. Anyway, a few months after I turned 18, I got on some dating apps. Mostly for fun, kind of like a fun game. 

Anyway, I matched with a guy on tinder. He was actually really fun to talk to! I immediately felt comfortable with him! And, I know this was incredibly stupid, but I let him drive me to our first date. I did have him meet me at a nearby park, so it was a tiny bit safer, but whatever. He was honestly very chill! 

And funny story, his car broke down(the car ran out of coolant), so instead of going on a hike(I know, another unsafe decision, but I love hiking. Well, more like walking along paved trails, lol! Because wheels) we ended up just taking a stroll through a neighborhood while getting to know each other! 

Then, we found a park and a bench, and we sat and talked and talked into the sun started to set! We clicked really fast, and when we got back to his car, it was cooled down enough that he was able to get me home(well, to the same park he picked me up at), and also we got ice cream from a place close to my house! It was so awesome! 

Anyway, we went on more and more dates! We went swimming, we got a book from the library, we stargazed, we painted with wax onto a candle(this was was super fun!), we made pizza, and so many more things! 

And throughout everything, he's been so understanding of my disabilities! He even carried me up a flight of stairs! He is a great cook too! Anyway, I fell like I'm ranting, but I'm genuinely so happy! We've been official for a week, and it's the best thing that's ever happened to me!

"I finally cut my screen time from 8 hours and 55 minutes to 1 hour and 28 minutes (Proof at the end) TL;DR: In four weeks, I’ve cut my average screen time from 8 hours and 55 minutes to 1 hour and 28 minutes on average. 



I know no one cares about this, but I still wanted to share it here just in case someone is facing the same problem and looking for motivation.



I recently finished my semester and got a summer break. My girlfriend and I planned our first big trip abroad, something we’d been looking forward to for more than a year. But after getting free from studies and exams, I got addicted to my phone, spending hours scrolling social media. My addiction started to ruin our plans and our excitement for the trip.



More than a month ago, my girlfriend spent a weekend finding resources to help me. She found an article with practical methods for different levels of phone addiction. Inspired by her effort, I decided to give it a shot.



Week 1 saw my screen time drop to 7 hours and 35 minutes on average, which made me very happy because I never thought anything would help me with my phone addiction. Even though I started with no hope, seeing this result gave me hope.



Week 2 brought it down further to 5 hours and 12 minutes on average. The key was a fun challenge my girlfriend and I did together to stay off our phones. Having her as my support system made everything so much easier.



In Week 3, I tried a $23 timed locker my girlfriend got from Amazon. It worked wonders, cutting my late-night screen time and improving my sleep. I ended the week with an average of 4 hours and 3 minutes on average. Despite a slight setback over the weekend due to feeling down, I’m happy with my progress, even though it was very little.



In the last week of this challenge, I kept up the same habits but added a new twist suggested by my girlfriend. We signed up for swimming classes and started going daily because we always wanted to learn swimming. It’s been fun, and I’m loving every second of it. I also started locking my phone for an hour in the morning using the timed locker. This helped me bring down my screen time to 1 hour and 28 minutes. While my initial goal was 1 hour or less, I’m proud of myself with my progress.



Honestly, I couldn't have achieved this without my girlfriend’s support. I’m incredibly grateful to have her in my life. Dating her was the best decision I've ever made. I want to write a big thank-you paragraph here, but I don't want to bore anyone.



Here is my screen time screenshot before I started: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JQVQaI1q7xgLUpojzx6osRci8zwwGWoJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JQVQaI1q7xgLUpojzx6osRci8zwwGWoJ/view?usp=sharing)

"I sang in public for the first time. I am so glad I am still here. TW: Self-harm, addiction, suicide, depression, eating disorders, abuse

I (24F) have a long history of mental health issues. My mother was emotionally abusive, I had undiagnosed ADHD, and began suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts when I was 10 years old.

The past 10 years have been a fight. I developed an eating disorder and fainted at school. I began to self harm. I have been in and out of therapy and tried many different medications.

At 19, during the pandemic, I began to heavily abuse alcohol. I knew I had a problem but I didn't care. I just wanted the pain to stop.

A year in, I attended an AA meeting at my local church. I have nothing against religion, but for me, it is a huge source of trauma. The group was not advitised as being religious, so it was a shock. I sat there, shaking, slightly tipsy, consumed with shame, fear, self-hatred, and a feeling of dread. I felt I would never be free. I felt I would always be broken. I felt I would never be able to improve and was destined to die from alcoholism or by my own hand. I felt so very alone. I hadn't spoken to my friends in a while- I was convinced everyone hated me.

I realised nothing was ever going to get better, and that my life was not worth living. I felt utterly broken.

Three years later, I finally found a therapist that I feel understands me. I have found the correct combination of medication. I have taken up meditation, exercise, and work two jobs I enjoy. I have hobbies again.

I still struggle, but things are better. I am able to stand the pain without breaking.

I have always loved to sing, so I took up singing lessons. I love it. My teacher told me I have some real talent, and wants to introduce me to some artists who are interested in writing/playing with me.

She puts on this ""concert"" every year, where lots of her students- kids, teenagers, the elderly, a huge range of ages and skill level- will perform a song or piano piece in front of friends and family.

I said no at first, but eventually I realised something. I have come so far, but I am never going to be ""normal"". I am never going to be able to meet a new person without feeling shaky. I am never going to be able to be able to answer the phone without deep breathing first. I am never going to be able to stand up on a stage without feeling like I'll puke or pass out.

But what's the alternative? I never do anything, ever. Because I'm too scared of getting hurt. I lived my life that way for 23 years, hoping to find a cure for all my fear. But that cure doesn't exist. And I don't want to curl up and rot anymore. I want to live, even if it means pain.

""Do it scared"" my therapist said. So that's what I did.

The concert was held in the same church as that horrid AA meeting, all those years ago.

I couldn't sleep the night before, I couldn't eat, and I was shaking so badly I could hardly stand. I'd never sung in public before, and I was terrified. Drinking crossed my mind. Self-harm crossed my mind. Backing out crossed my mind more than once. Self-pity, hatred, loneliness. My mother's voice rang in my head. I did not think anyone would come to support me. It was so small and silly, after all.

But I walked into that church, two years sober, on wobbly legs, and stood on the stage.

And I sang.

My best friend came. She surprised me entirely. She beamed and clapped and cheered along with all the other sweet people who attended. She bought me flowers. I burst into tears later. She hugged me and told me she was so proud of me, that I was amazing. I felt so much love. I used to be so afraid and ashamed to show emotion. Now, it's like I can't stop. And I don't want to.

Hours later, I am staring out at the night sky. I thought I would never be able to do anything like this. And later, I thought I would never be able to do it without alcohol.

If I'd backed out, it wouldn't have been a failing. But I'm so glad I did it.

Three years ago, I was suicidal, an active alcoholic, lonely and afraid.

Today, I am sober, my best friend bought me flowers, and I sung one of my favourite songs in front of 50 people. It was small, but to me it felt so big. And that's okay, isn't it? To give small things significance? I used to wonder why anyone cared when ""nothing really mattered"". But now, now it all matters to me. Because I realised if I don't give the small things meaning, nothing ever really matters at all. And I want them to matter.

I am still afraid. I am still terrified.

But now I know I can do it. Now I know it cannot break me.

When people used to tell me ""it gets better"", I used to think it was bullshit. But now, I understand. For the first time, I truly get it.

I am so grateful today. I know how lucky I am, and my chest feels too small for all the emotion I feel. I always thought that was a flaw in me, to feel so much. Now I feel it is a gift. A double edged sword, but a gift all the same. What a privilidge to be human, and to feel so damn much.

I'm going to keep moving forward, even if I slow to a crawl. I am proud of myself, even if no one else ever is.

My mother's voice is quiet for now. I drowned it out. Something I always longed to do and never thought I ever could. That's proved you wrong, I thought. Because I may be afraid and shaky and small on that stage, but I still stood up and sang. After all these years, I found my voice. And it soared, in that tiny church. My god, it soared.

I'm glad I'm still here. And I am glad I am alive.",excited,Happy
"My cat has so many habits that are unique to him and I love it Glooby (real name Flurry but goes by Glooby) plays the “Light switch game” every night when my mom goes to bed. He knows to race her upstairs to the light switch and will try to prevent her from turning off the lights.

He also doesn’t always land on all 4s, like way more than cats usually mess up.

He also thinks his fluffy bed is his cat mom and he grooms it.

He loves to put his entire paw in my coffee if I’m not looking. It’s not any other hot drink, just coffee. No cold ones either

He always has to immediately test the litterbox every time I’m done cleaning, no matter what.

He loves to watch hockey on my TV. But only the Seattle Kraken (maybe the blue-green? but he doesn’t like Vancouver or Dallas)

Everytime we watch TV, everyone has their own couch. If we have my brother over, he literally will wait for us to sit and then choose the only open couch left and sit there.

There are nights when he will just snack and not have dinner after not having breakfast and having a small lunch.  He sent me so many pictures of food he made today and it made me so happy. <3 Him taking more care of himself while I’m away just makes me so happy!!! ",excited,Happy

He’s been really casually worried if about me making plans Saturday and when I sent him a link to a 4 hour sword making and fighting class, he said NO, and “hoped we could go wine tasting that day.”

EXCUSE ME?! NO TO SWORDS?! 

Also asking me where my favorite nail place is and offering to drive me lol.

"I’ve become that person i used to imitate when i was a child As we grow up, we often imitate identities we aspire to. Unknowingly, I became the person I once dreamed of. I always wanted to be that care free girl who goes on solo trips and rides bike. Eventually i got very comfortable being alone and now i enjoy my company the most.
 In my family, most girls marry in their early twenties, and I thought I would too. But, over the time, things got better and I’m living my life the way I always wanted to. 

There's so much more to come, and I believe that if we trust ourselves and work toward our dreams, we can make them happen.",excited,Happy

"Started my health journey at 21 years old, attempting to reverse diabetes Recently I (F21) decided I wanted to take control of my health, and have started taking steps to. I have T2 diabetes that has gone untreated for most of my life (since 12ish). My mom had untreated diabetes, and gave it to me through what she fed me. I havent been able to do much about it until I moved out this year in January. Now I have choices in how I want to live, eat, buy groceries, ect.

Finally got my glucometer on my own to check bloodsugar. My mom refused to get one for me when I was a child because it hurt her ego when doctors told her she wasn't feeding me properly. She didn't want me on medication, or diets, ect. Ba

For the last 6 weeks I have meal-prepped healthier\* (still working on it) dinners to avoid eating out at all, its been pretty successful. I went from eating out several times a week, to once on the weekends. Now I can track my bloodsugar too! :) I've took to journaling my meals, and day-to day activities. I'm feeling a lot better than before, less lethargic. The blood sugar numbers are still technically high, but I've made great progress without meds involved.",excited,Happy
"After many ups and downs, I've passed my medical school finals! I'm a graduate medical student in the UK. For some reason, we sit our final written exams in the penultimate year, and I just got my results back. I got 81%! In previous years, I've been averaging high 60s and this is my best grade since A levels. Most people get between 60-75%.

Not to focus on negatives, but I've been through a lot in the last few years. I've had health issues, lost multiple family members, and there's been some other events which I won't go into. But I'm so glad I can (hopefully) become a doctor next year and help more people who have been through similar experiences.

I've got another year of med school and then my final OSCEs, which are the practical exams, then I'll be a doctor 😬

"I'm so excited for college and my new laptop and I don't have anyone to tell so this is a still happy vent!! My stepdad helped me pick out a laptop for school next month. I never thought I'd go to college so getting ready for it is so exciting and nerve racking. The newest tech I own is my phone which was a trade in and my $100 TV from Walmart. I'm still using a 14 year old tablet to draw on. Anyways something like this is big for me and when we finally settled on it and payed I told my mom to transfer my savings to his account (He has Amazon prime so he payed.) and he stood up and said ""happy birthday."" We've always had a on and off tense relationship so my mom and him planning to pay for it was so meaningful. 

Anyways it comes on the 15th I'm so excited for it and it'll be all mine to customize. I also have to buy more things too but since I'm not there yet and still gotta move in it's all kinda waiting. I'm so lucky to have saved up a couple thousand this year for school and after such a tough schooling career I'm ready to put my all into this. I never stayed in a school for very long from constantly moving and my childhood was very tough. I barely made it through highschool and thought I wouldn't achieve anything.

"My mother (mid 40s) is finally trying to understand me as a person (17 ftm) instead of trying to shape me into the person she wants me to be. This is a happy rant because I just want to get this out. My mother is finally starting to understand me as a person. She's starting to understand my interests and my feelings, she's actively trying to learn about me so we can bond and it's working! For the first time in years I feel like she sees me as an individual instead of the person she wanted be to be. When we went to the mall to spoil ourselves after a hard week, instead of focusing on trying to get me to wear feminine clothes, she helped me find masculine clothing that I'd like and I'm so happy, she understands my special interests and hyperfixations and tries to learn about them to understands why I like it so much! She's also starting to understand how to take care of me as a nerodivergant person, she's being more gentle and is actually helping me when I'm overwhelmed or disassociating. I'm so excited and happy, I thought she'd never understand me or try to figure me out as a person and that I'd have to cut her off. But after she saw how much I was hurting, I think she finally realized that she needed to change, I finally have my mother back and I'm so so happy!",excited,Happy

"I finally got glasses and everything is beautiful. This is a long, very happy rant. I can't rant out of happiness this hard to anyone in my life rn

I am so happy. I can't stop talking about my glasses and it's probably getting annoying, because everyone has glasses. But I feel like a lot of people just got glasses when they first started needing them and didn't just have terrible vision that was ignored for most of their lives to the point of developing eye problems over it, and then suddenly get it corrected like in an instant, and I literally cannot shut up about it. What I thought was pretty normal vision was actually complete dogshit and now I am seeing things I couldn't even imagine a few weeks ago.

And holy shit. I pretty much immediately got hit with the heavy fist of depth perception for the first time in my life and spent like half an hour touching the sink and putting my hands in the corners of the room because everything was suddenly EXTREMELY 3D. I feel like I am in an actual video game. I used to joke that video games are higher definition than my actual vision but not right now.

Everything is so BRIGHT. Everything is so DETAILED. Grass doesn't all blend together anymore, everything on my shelf is a distinct individual object, I can see a face a few feet away, hell I can read something across the street. It's nuts. Colours are so sharp and saturated now, life isnt a foggy haze around me, everything is in such intense focus and detail I keep just staring at little things and tearing up. 

AND I CAN ACTUALLY READ OH MY GOD. I've been afraid to Crack open a novel because I'm afraid it's going to be too good to be true, but as far as scrolling on my phone, sentences and words are so crisp and distinct. I don't have to hold it at right up to my actual nose, close one eye and squint just to have my eye bounce all over the page and give me a headache after about one sentence. 

And better, I haven't had double vision in days. I used to get it every day like clockwork around 2pm until the end of the day. Since putting on my glasses, I guess my brain just. Isn't trying to mash together two extremely different visual fields anymore and giving up or something (I'm not a doctor, that makes sense to me though)

I'm just losing my mind. I never want to take them off. I have to force myself to take them off at bedtime. I want to order 500 pairs and put them on a special shelf like a shrine lol. I have never been more greatful for anything before.

It's insane how bad I let this get under the guise of ""it's always been like this, it was like this when I grew up, can't imagine it gets that much better than this now."" It's like the Crack in your windshield that you eventually stop noticing until your windshield explodes.",excited,Happy

"I Am Wildly Fortunate For The Life I Live I was invited out to a small shindig by a close friend, out on a small property in the bush. Upon arriving, I was handed a small, book-style notepad, and told that it was tonight's Burn Book, and how it was 'a thing' for anyone who wanted to... to write in the book negative things in their life that they wanted to 'burn away'. At the apex of the event, the book would be tossed on the fire, and ideally anything written in it would eventually be scourged from the writer's life in the same way that the book went up in consuming fire.



I hung onto the book for a while, trying to think of what I might write in it. It honestly got to the point where I felt like I was bogarting the thing, because I just couldn't come up with fuck all to add to it, and felt weird hanging onto it for so long without writing shit-all



Friends, strangers, it felt so strange to hand it back to the guy who was minding the book after writing nothing in it, but … Honestly, also good to acknowledge my genuine, non-monetary, wealth.



I have a roof over my head and edible food in my fridge. I have no reason to think this will change any time soon. Husband is not stingy at all, nor does he guilt me or pester me about needing to lean on him for financial things if I did. I know this because, for a while, I did have to.

I am in good health, and so is my beloved. Our pets are healthy and a joy to be around. Both my family and his are in good health, and we are both in regular communication with each other (he texts my mother on his own, without ever mentioning to me, and I am often in contact with his mother in the same manner. Our mothers have even met, and loved each other!)



We have our health, our home, food on the table, regular and welcomed contact with our loved ones, stable jobs, and good relationships with friends and family both.



What could I possibly write in that book that wouldn't seem shallow and pandering? ""OooOOoooh NoooOOOo I'm sad he forgot to put the dishes away that one time! Woe is me, I was a little too busy last week and only talked to my mother for half an hour, instead of a whole hour! Boo Hoo, I burnt some of the rice when I made a big dinner the other night- everything was delicious, but I sure did burn a little bit of the rice...""



I am so lucky. Parts of my life have challenged me, to be sure, but I've never been without a place to sleep, I've never been hungry because I legitimately could not access edible food. I've never been truly alone without friend, family, or loved one.



I had nothing to add to that book. My life is truly good, and I am so unbelievably lucky to be able to say so without caveat or asterisk.",excited,Happy
"My life is so beautiful, and I want to tell you all because I need to get it off my chest I’ve been through so much shit, but I’ve got my life and my mental health under control to look back on the worst moments with a good state of mind and take everything as a lesson.

I take advice from people who I want to live like.

"Today I had a real ""and then everyone clapped"" story It's not an interesring story, but it made me happy so whatever, roast me if you want.

So I (28f) have a 2-year-old rescue dog and I am taking him to dog school twice a week (1 one-on-one session and 1 group session). We've been going to dog school since he was around 6 months old and I've realised that I absolutely love it and my trainers say that I am actually quite good regarding the technical parts of dog training (hand positions, body posture, recognisig problems and the proper solutions for them). 

Anyway, today before the actual obedience part of the session we were warming up the dogs with some streching exercises when one of the trainers told me that I should try and do an exercise with my dog which we've never done before. Basically there was a stool in front of my dog and he had to sit down while his front paws were up on the stool. That's it (yes, I know, this doesn't seem like anything even remotely noteworthy, but it actually can be quite difficult to achieve).

My dog is familiar with the stool, he can stand on it in different ways and sit on it as well, but getting a dog to sit while his front paws are on something higher is a challenge. I was trying to get him to sit, he did't really understand what I wanted him to do and he was unsure about the whole situation so I was guiding him with my hands and then he did it! Not even once, like three separate times!

I was very happy with him and then one of my trainers said to the group that what we just did was actually pretty hard especially finding out the solution so quickly and that they didn't actually think I would succeed so soon and that I should be applauded because what I did was a big thing and then everyone started clapping. For like 2 seconds, very awkwardly, but still. It felt so good. 

That's it, that's my big story. If you read it then thank you so much for your time, you can go on with your day now.",excited,Happy
"I've been getting happier each day and I think I found out why I know sometimes we feel bad, really bad, but we need to know that things will get better. I was really sad about a month ago, then I got over it and here I am, happy. You know, this world is so amazing, we have beautiful beaches, warm seas, cold seas, very cold seas, hills, mountains, endless fields of golden wheat, beautiful forests, big rivers... this planet is so good. Sure, we have to work/study, but at the end of the day you realize that this is part of life, and what would life be without hard work? Well, I am a student, and recently I have found some joy in studying. It's like knowing that you are suffering a little bit, but also knowing that you will get good grades and maybe get into a cool university, right? I'm think that the reason why I am so happy is because **I am finding joy even in the bad parts of life**. I also get happy just by imagining beautiful landscapes. Yeah, that's right, imagining beautiful landscapes. I discovered this after a recent anxiety attack I had. Since then, strangely, I haven't had any of those.

Anyway... thanks for reading me yapping about how good life is to me. I hope you find your way to happiness, just like I am finding mine. Life is too short to be sad about things that are just slightly frustrating. Be the best you can be, help others, find joy in your own way. Feel free to share what makes you happy in the comments. Have a nice day!

Brief backstory, I started off at 250 pounds and decided that I didn't want to live like this anymore. I started moving, cut out sodas, and joined a gym for light lifting. My weight loss has kind of plateaued, but there is good news in this. My muscle mass is up and my body fat percentage is down.

"my ma complimented my singing in the car, and it made my day i’ve (20m) always loved singing and have been working really hard on my voice for a long time (i’ve only had like a week of actual training) and performed a few times for fun. my voice lately has made me dysphoric occasionally because i’m a trans guy that’s a soprano, but i really love to sing and i’m proud of my voice even though it gets me misgendered (which makes me pretty insecure about it)

anyway today on the way back home from getting groceries my parents and i were singing along to bon jovi and ma stopped singing for a second and said “you have a really nice voice. it’s very pleasing to listen to” then went back to singing

and i’ve been thinking about it since. it really means a lot, especially from someone i’m so close to. my parents and i have been close for awhile so having them be casually proud of me is wonderful

so i just wanted to share the happiness with yall😄",excited,Happy
"this might sound weird, but it makes me happy. my boyfriend saves spiders.  he’s definitely not an arachnophile. 
but he saves every single spider he sees in our home. 

90% of the time they show up in our bedroom, and our bedroom has absolutely no way for a spider to get in from the outside. they seem to migrate there from other parts of the house. 

so he scoops them up and puts them behind our living room TV to build webs and live. he’s made it their little sanctuary. 

his reasoning for not putting the spiders out is this:

“if they were born inside our house, then they might not survive outside. i can’t just let them die like that. if they came in here from the outside, then they were only seeking warmth, quiet, and shelter. they keep insects out for us. they don’t bother us.”

we even have two bathroom spiders. those ones are my favorites. EVERY single time i take a bubble bath, one of them will slide down its web and hang out on the edge of the bathtub. i talk to it. i’m starting to wonder if it understands me. it never comes down when my boyfriend takes a bath or either of us take showers. when i’m done with the bath, it shimmies back up to its web. 


he checks on the spider colony behind the TV sometimes and most of the spiders are still there (although some have died and we’ve held little funerals for them), happily hanging out and thriving. they’ve never bothered us. 

and we’ve never had an issue with insects ☺️",excited,Happy

"I just bought my first ever car for myself and I couldn’t be more happy I’m so excited I could explode. I just want to ramble about this because I’m so excited and I’ve already rambled to all my family and friends and I need another outlet.

The car I had before this one was a great little car gifted to me by my parents, but being a Mini it couldn’t handle the country roads and was always in the shop. Plus east coast winters are brutal and being such a compact car it wasn’t the best to drive during poor road conditions. It was a used car as well, 11 years old as of this year, so it had quite a few kilometres on it. It was a great first car that lasted me many years, but I really wanted an upgrade.

I sold my car and used the money I got for it, plus a little extra that I had put away, to put a down payment on a new used car. But I got so lucky with the car I found. I found it the same day I sold my car, and it was just a spur of the moment decision to check out the dealership. It’s a 2021 Kia sedan and it’s basically brand new. Barely driven, only 24,000km on it, it still smells new and it’s immaculately clean and this is before the dealer has even had it detailed. 

From the research my step-dad and I have done on the car model, it seems to be a really solid car. Standard little car issues, average yearly maintenance cost, no recalls on the model, good reviews and the biggest complaint my step-dad found is that it has poor anti-theft measures, which isn’t great but we live in the country and theft is not a high likelihood out here.

And on top of all this it’s just beautiful. I think it’s a stunning little car. Standard but sleek, very comfortable cabin, smooth ride, it’s just amazing. Runs smooth as glass my step-dad said. We also got a good price on it, similar cars from Kia run for around $19.5k to $22k and we got it for 19 flat. It also has tons of little goodies, apple car play, heated seats, lots of trunk storage space; I can’t wait until I pick it up to see all the other neat little things it has.

I love to drive and I love my cars. My cars get used a lot, I love to explore and travel, I take road trips home which is 1500km away at least twice a year, so I am so, *so* excited to have a nice, comfortable, reliable car. It even has a remaining 1.5 years left on its manufacturer’s warranty!

And I did this! I was able to make this happen after months of planning and an amazing stroke of luck! I’m so grateful to my parents for all of their support and for giving me the car that helped me get this car in the first place. I’m glad all of the work and money I put into maintaining and repairing that car paid off when I sold it, I got the exact price for it that I wanted and valued the car at.

Most of my life is full of shit luck and failed plans, our family is cursed in that way, so I’m just ecstatic that everything worked out so well for me here. I’m sure the universe will make up for it later down the line when things inevitably go to shit again, but for now I’m happy about the good things happening to me right now. :)",excited,Happy

"I found the right person, and I’m living a dream. I never thought I’d be this happy in a relationship. After meeting my current partner by pure chance, everything just clicked. We started talking, and it felt so natural. I didn’t try to impress her, I was simply myself, and things flowed beautifully.

Now we’re married, and expecting our first child, which fills me with so much joy. We share similar goals, and communication between us is incredible. We support each other, work through things together, and there’s such a strong sense of mutual care. I’ve never felt this level of connection and trust with anyone before.

We’re preparing for the arrival of our baby and planning for the future. It makes me incredibly happy to see how excited she is about being a mom, talking to our baby, and thinking about the things we’ll do as a family.

We even enjoy the simple things together, like taking care of our pets, cooking, and cleaning. It’s like I’m living a dream, and I feel so lucky to have found the right person to share this life with. I couldn’t ask for more, and I look forward to many more happy moments with her.",excited,Happy

"I think I’m finally starting to feel happy again. Life is finally starting to move again. I’m happy again

My life has been so stagnant for a while. I thought things would never change, I thought I wouldn’t change. I finally started to be happy with what I do and how I do it. I got my truck, my job, college around the corner. It feels like I can finally start living again. Honestly these past few years were the worst, but now they were all just lessons for me. I couldn’t appreciate the pain more. I’m thankful for the experiences and lessons, and that’s that. ",excited,Happy

"Today My dad met his Bio-father after over 50 years of searching… And it was amazing. There were struggles, Bio-dad has Alzheimer’s, and the meeting we may have wanted can’t be. So it goes. But the family…. His brother and sister… were incredible. Loving and warm and inviting. My dad got to feel accepted in away he never has before. 

He’s felt a hole in his life for so long. Like this was missing and it was exacerbated by his mom who is a piece of work that lied about his father’s identify for 48 years. Which fuck you just don’t do to a kid…. And then continue so long in to adult hood. 

And he heard stories, and learned how alike he and  his dad are and he and his brother HAVE THE SAME DAMN EYES this sort of light blue grey that’s sharp and piercing. His father and he have the same laugh (deep, from the belly) and his sister has a warmth and wit that was so familiar.  

His step mom (doesent feel right, but easiest descriptor) was amazing. You could  easily see her being  conflicted  that her husband of 50 years had a child she didn’t know about…. Never. She was supportive from the minute she heard. She wanted them to meet for both their sakes. (Also her Apple cake is phenomenal) 

It was bitter sweet in some  ways but ultimately… today was beautiful. It was a step in healing and a piece of his identity he has wanted for so long. 

Today was amazing and I’m happy as hell",excited,Happy

"I can finally love my dog without feeling guilty My first dog was with me from my ages 15 to 30. She was there when my life was at it hardest and she sadly never got to meet my husband or share in the life we built- she would have loved it. It took me three years to process my grief or so I thought but getting a puppy opened up another phase of grief I hadn't accounted for.  
We got a puppy a year and a half ago and I just looked at her and my heart felt so full but without tje guilt I felt for so long!

It feels like everything that happened previously in my life was solely meant to lead to that situation. Like now, all makes sense. It was 43 years of training and now i can finally experience the real stuff! I've never felt so happy, fulfilled, zero stress, everything is simple and enjoyable. All is natural and purely honest. No manipulation, no hidden shit. No man ever acted like he does with me...

I'm purely happy and extremely grateful for that gift <3",excited,Happy

Then I met my wonderful and loving husband who married me and I got my green card after 10 years. Now we have 2 kittens, living in a nice duplex , traveling when we can, leading a very stable life.

"I am finally done! I've lost nearly 100lbs (46kg)! Hey all! I've been on the weightloss train for nearly 3-4 years now! I am only 5',3"", so at my biggest of 215lbs, I was quite heavy for my size. 
I began to simply just eat less, take in less sugar, reduce my portions, and begin walking (10k steps a day). 
Towards the end of my journey I began running and working out as well, which helped me over come plateaus, as well as reducing sugar to nearly 0. 
I am now 120lbs. I may lose 5 more pounds to be 115lbs, but we'll see. It took me nearly half a decade, but I can rest now knowing it is finally accomplished! ",excited,Happy

"I drove my car a long distance without stalling today and im very happy  For a few months ive been learning how to drive stick because for my birthday i was gifted a mini cooper (my dream car) but the catch was it was a stick shift. The first time i drove it i stalled atleast 20 times, for like 2 weeks straight i would practice everyday, i screamed a lot, even cried sometimes. But since i ws practicing, i did eventually get better. When i first started driving on the road (i practiced on in my driveway) i stalled on a hill 10 times and my mom ended up having to switch and drive the rest of the way. But after a while i got better. For a while, ive been scared of driving a long distance, but today i finally drove more than 5 minutes down the road and i feel amazing. All that practice paid off.

"Small Victory: Finally spoke up for myself, told someone how I REALLY felt!  I had this old acquaintance from highschool who has talked to me many times in the past — but all of those attempts ended in him making me uncomfortable, so I’d break it off. 

He reached out again but this time I did reply, but before we talked for a while, I had the guts/courage to tell him how I feel & how I don’t wish to continue conversation with him. I feel strong for being able to overcome my fear of his reaction. 

I know it may not seem like much, but in my eyes it was something big for me to overcome. I was always scared of rejection or hurt feelings, so I’d force myself into situations I didn’t want to, to appease others. But now, I did it! I spoke up!

Just a little victory for a socially anxious woman🤍🤍",excited,Happy

It’s a great location and a nice place. Only downside is that I wanted a two bedroom and this is a one bedroom. But overall I’m so excited to finally have a place of my own! I’ve been dreaming of this for a while now and to make it a reality is amazing. While waiting for the approval to come through, I’ve been looking on Amazon for furniture and stuff and it’s so fun to pick everything out!

"I’m lucky to have met these people. I love them all like family.  I was told I was loved last night.

It wasnt by a girlfriend or a family member but just by a friend while surrounded by friends that I didn’t know two months ago. They are all now my closest friends. 

She just sorta said it on autopilot and almost stopped herself but said it anyway. In a way that was clearly accidental but you could tell she meant it. She only meant it in a platonic way but that made it all the more heartwarming to me. That someone that wasn’t my family or a girl who liked my looks said they loved me. That it was me she loved and not my looks or because she had to. I said it back and it just felt right. Like I also meant it even though the thought hadn’t crossed my mind till then.  

Two months ago I was in a dark place. Now I can confidently say I’m surrounded by people I love that feel the same.

Stay strong all of you. Things will get better. 

TLDR: things are better now and I feel loved and accepted. ",excited,Happy

Yesterday I watched him shorten a trip by a week because he didn't want to be away from me for so long. And he wants to be here as I start a new semester and a new internship. The trip was planned way before we met and while I would've been ok with him being away, I'm really happy to spend some more time with him. He makes me really happy. And I don't have to question his intentions about me. He tells me every time and backs it with actions. I'm happy here. Kk bye.

"I just taught my first Gardening with Disabilities class and I'm super happy! Just taught my first class!

I work full time and I'm a caregiver of an adult child with ASD. I'm always on the move. I fell in love with small scale (like just in my kitchen) gardening. During the COVID pandemonium, I noticed that there wasn't a lot of accessibility with regard to public gardens. I thought I would explore becoming a Master Gardener for the Cooperative Extension so that I could bring information and education to those who generally don't have access to it; to help guide how to build their gardens so that people with mobility issues & cognitive & developmental disabilitiea could also be a part of that community. This is difficult to do as most Master Gardeners are several years into their retirement & have time. 
Well, I poo-poo'd on that as an excuse and didn't let it go.
I lead my first class today and the fact that I had a full roster of interested folks has me over the moon that I'm on the right track with getting the info out to my community. I've been working so hard and I'm just so happy that it's all coming together! Woohoo!!",excited,Happy

"I overcame my dysfunctional attachment patterns and finally have the love I always wanted! It's been almost 3 years and we're still happy together! We talk openly, our routine is enjoyable, the sex is amazing. I love her deeply, respect her and wish to marry her! I see her in my future and I trust her completely, I'm able to forgive her for her mistakes and I see her aligned with me, I've never had that before. I really admire this women and everything we built together. 

After so much trauma, failed relationships and a lot of therapy I finally found the love of my life, she's my family. I'm not saying it's easy, it's not. Every day I get over the negative things my brain generates to be able to be the person she deserves me to be, so I can have the life I deserve. Sometimes, I can't even believe this is my reality. I'm so happy and just felt like sharing this.

To everyone navigating the emotional rollercoaster of life: things can get better. Be patient, and don't let the right person slip away. Give love and allow yourself to receive love.",excited,Happy
"I love when our security cameras go off! My husband put new security cameras up at our house as there were some theft reports in the nearby area (nothing major, just stuff stolen off porches, that sort of thing). It's set up so we can both see the feeds on our phones, and get notifications when something is detected.

First few times my phone went off I was so anxious someone was at our house. Now, I LOVE IT. There are SO MANY neighborhood cats that roam around and like to hang on our porch that I didn't know about! I knew most of the cats from just seeing them around, but there's a few new ones I've seen lately, plus our neighbor's three-legged cat hangs out on our porch all the time.

It is just the best little interruption to my day now when my phone goes off, because I get to pull up a video of a cute cat hanging out.

Not sure how much my husband likes it because now he gets my texts about the new cats and when he runs home during the day and I try to scare him by hollering through the camera at him.

Security cameras are the best yall.",excited,Happy

"For the first time in 8 years, I did not have to pay rent on the first week of a month. Been out of college and working for over 8 years now. Lived on rent till now in hostels, independent houses and apartments. I bought a small apartment in a gated society last year and it got completed recently. Finally moved in at the end of last month.

"Had a realization waking up this morning I woke up today in my own apartment. It might be with a roommate but my name is on that lease and that room is mine. 

Yesterday for the first time ever I bought real new furniture! The kind that comes new and in a box and wasn't just picked up from the trash on the side of the road. It's a full bedroom set for my brand new place a new mattress and everything! (My ex got to keep the new mattress I bought during our relationship) and that was a powerful moment for me. 

Sitting in my car after financing my furniture and looking at that silly little folder with my invoice in it I couldn't help but shed some happy tears. I finally feel like a real adult and real person with my own real life. My family issues I've suffered through never touched this place. Nobody ever broke the bed or the dresser in anger. Nobody spilled alcohol on my brand new bed the second it landed in the room. Nobody told me I can't have the bedspread I want. Nobody assaulted me here. No bad memories have been made here. 

Now I get to fill MY space with what I want and how I want. So I bought my favorite bedspread and that silly painting and a giant giraffe statue. I got beautiful curtains I can't wait to hang and have my cat get hair all over. I can hang my achievements without someone making me feel bad about them. I can thrive here yall. I can start my life anew and happy and that's all I've ever hoped for. Happiness, pure unadulterated happiness is all I want in my life. I wake up every day so unbelievable happy my heart hurts. Things stress me out but it's not the end of the world and I am still happy. Unmedicated as well which I never thought was an option! 

So it's just me and my cat taking on the world! With an incredible man by my side that I'm falling for and a really good roommate who I met through reddit! Life is beautiful yall I'm thankful every single day I never opted out and failed when I tried. Life can change yall

I couldn’t itch my face, I couldn’t emote without pain, it felt like everyone was looking at me. But after 6 months of using panoxyl, I have almost no acne. I can look at myself in the mirror again, I don’t feel like everyone is judging me or think I’m gross. I can furrow my brows and smile and screw my eyes shut and it doesn’t hurt. I still have a lot of acne scars but at this point I don’t care. I don’t feel miserable and gross anymore and it’s amazing. ",excited,Happy

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!!

"I am actually a millennial that came from nothing and is doing great. I am happy Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts.",excited,Happy

I was skating with my friend and, while we were resting, she asked for my Instagram.
I had to catch my train home that same day, so we parted ways.
While on the train, my friend dared me to text her.
After one week of constant chatting, she asked me if i liked her, to which i responded that i indeed really liked her.
At first i thought she was going to reject me, like every time before, but then she told me she liked me too.
This happened two days before my 16th birthday, and it made me the happiest person ever.

He was a very long time alcoholic and used to tell me how much he absolutely hated me when he would get really drunk. Would tell me all the worst things he thought.

The man I've started seeing now is so different. He's not a drinker at all. He's so kind and has such a good heart. He bought a very nice bottle of scotch and we both had a drink. I expected a full drink like my ex would do and he pours the equivalent of 2 shots and takes one and then we try a bottle of bourbon he had same way. He puts the bottles away not even close to drunk and we had an incredible night. He didn't scream at me or make me feel like shit or start an argument. He held my hand and honestly just made me feel like the only person in the world. He's just so good and I almost don't know how to accept it. I don't think I've ever been luckier, in fact I'd say I used up all my luck just meeting him. 

Not everyone is the same and people really can be good inside, don't settle for anything less than the best you deserve (which is the absolute best btw)",excited,Happy
"I got to see my favorite sculpture in real life today totally on accident! I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection! 

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!",excited,Happy
"My in-laws are moving in with us and I'm legitimately excited I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too.",excited,Happy

He tells me how he has planned meet ups at her job. He doesn’t drive (I don’t drive either) and doesn’t want to tell his older brother because he finds it “gross” when he talks to him about this stuff but it’s so cute. So he walks about 6 miles in total to meet her, and omg he is so sweet.

"It’s my birthday and I’m so happy today  I ended last year in a terrible place mentally. But starting in January, 2024, I cut down on drinking, I walked at least 5 miles everyday, I stayed away from people and events that made me want to drink and went on hikes in new places and kayaking instead. I’ve lost the weight I needed to and I feel like a real person again. I never thought, being in my fifties, that I could ever feel attractive again, wanted again. It’s been a wonderful day today and I feel like the rest of the year is going to be equally productive and rewarding! ",excited,Happy

"Just want everyone to know how happy I am  NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall",excited,Happy
"Waiting for the right person to come along, even if it's years, is so worth it.  My boyfriend and I almost always play pool during our lunch break, more often than not betting something per game. Well, the bet we're cashing in this weekend is something I'm really looking forward to! We're gonna lay out blankets and pillows galore in the living room, introduce him to Star Wars for May 4th, order some ramen, snuggle puddle with my bunny (he loves my bf), and add pictures to our lovey dovey scrapbook.   
  
This man is so sweet, I'm truly able to let out my hopeless romantic side with him and get it right back without hesitation. Not to mention I just renewed my lease and we added his name to it! Having a safe and healthy love is one of the greatest feelings in the world. I love and adore him, and feel so giddy knowing he's just as crazy about me, too. :)",excited,Happy

"One of those compliments I’ll still remember in 20 years As a skinny person (25M), I’ve had body image issues for a while. My first long term girlfriend left me in large part because of this and it planted a seed which grew to become part of my lasting insecurities.
I’ve been working out on and off for a couple of years and a little more recently. Today while doing body weight exercises at the parc, this little girl (10yo tops) came up to me and asked me « How do you have so much muscle ». Can’t explain how sweet it felt.",excited,Happy

"I'm happy with my 'life choices' and hope you are too. I have a demanding professional role, I'm good at it and I dig it. I have an iconic PhD in an area of my choosing that 'broke the mould'. I found a beautiful (in every sense) life partner, I've got a respectable income and a gorgeous home. My folks and family are still around and I do my best to be there for them. 

I've always followed my nose, leant in to my values and given my best. I also think it's fair to ask when in need, and do. I hope this doesn't seem humblebrag.

My favourite thing of all is being a home maker. I love to cook, to welcome my partner home, to think of the things my partner wants and needs (so many failures), but it's a principle that defines my existence.

I've also spent years in therapy to get to depths in myself I didn't know. Some days and some moments suck monkey ass. That's life. I'm sad for our planet, its species, future generations, genral levels of awareness and truth. I guess every generation has moments akin to this. 

Thanks for reading. I hope your life, and the way you iteract with those around you points to a better future for you and all.

I hope you feel peaceful, I've found it helps.

"Meeting the artist that got me through the darkest time in my life I'm typing this with tears rolling down my cheeks. I can't remember the last time I've ever been this happy. I just needed to put it somewhere which is why I'm writing this. I also don't want to specify the artist just because he's someone a lot of people make fun of the way he looks or they think his music is bad and I just want to share this without judgement. 

Last night I saw my favorite artist live in concert, and attended a meet and greet with him. I was so nervous to ask him for a hug but I'm so glad I did. I don't think I'll ever forget what it felt like to be held by him. It wasn't even like a side hug or an air hug, he wrapped his arms around me and gave me a little squeeze. It keeps replaying in my head.

When I found this artist, I was struggling so deeply. I was addicted to pills, almost failing out of college, and just got broken up with by my first love. Things felt so dark and then I found his music and it resonated with me so deeply. I started watching interviews of him and following him on social media and I quickly learned his character. A lot of the time, especially in the genre this artist is in, the music is good but the artist is really shitty. Not him. 

I'm still processing that this really happened. He was so kind. I told him how much he means to me and he thanked me and shared kind words. I already said this, but I haven't been this happy in so long. I know when I'm having a hard time, I'll be able to think about last time and feel a little bit better. I feel so blessed.",excited,Happy

"When i least expected it, it was homocide! I run in the morning every other day. Today was a running day and damn I WAS NOT FEELING LIKE IT AT ALL! Damn! Whatever! I warmed up, took longer than usual, and then started hitting the road. It was actually nice to be out in the beginning. I really really wanted to complete 5 km under 25 minutes, but damn my calf muscles started hurting like an annoying classmate from middle school. Especially the left calf. My power output was low, and those climbs were hard. Damn! I was like man ""I am not going to make 5 km under 25 minutes"". ""Not happening today"",""My body is not delivering it cause I did too much strength training yesterday"", ""it is too hot this morning"", ""the winds are not favorable"",""this left calf muscle, WTF!""..blah blah blah you know, the mental works. Anyhow, I check my Apple Watch and I gots 530 meters left till I hit 5 km. At that point I just let go, completely let go and I ran like Usain Bolt, OMG! I gave it my all! All of it! And lo and behold, I completed 5 km in 24 minutes and 59 seconds! AHHHH! I AM NOT KIDDING! I am not! I was like WHAT?!?!?! Goes to show why keeping up a habit is important, even in the face of adversity. I need to remind myself of that for it was my consistent application of running in many previous mornings that actually delivered that ability in spite of that consistent complaining in my head throughout the run. Ladies and gentlemen, I murdered that 5k. Yes, it was homocide! And I am so proud of myself! 🫶",excited,Happy

"5-month progress: Cutting down my Screen time was one of the best decisions of my life (Thanks to my girlfriend and Discipulus)  A few months ago, I shared how I cut my screen time 8h 55m to just 1h 25m. It’s been 5 months, so I figured it’s time for an update!  

Now, let me spill the tea on how cutting my screen time has seriously changed my life:

1. **More Time for the Good Stuff:** Less time scrolling = more time doing things I actually love, like swimming, reading, studying, or just hanging out with my favorite people. Oh, and the focus? Unreal. I can now get through tasks without a million distractions pulling me away.

2. **Bye-Bye, FOMO:** Turning off constant notifications and ditching the mindless scrolling felt SO freeing. I’m no longer glued to what everyone else is doing, and honestly? I’m way happier just living in the moment and doing my own thing.

3. **Sleep = Leveled Up:** Cutting out phone time at night was a game-changer. I wake up feeling rested (finally!) and ready to tackle the day. My bedtime routine now feels like a cozy ritual instead of a late-night doom-scroll marathon.

4. **Actually Being Present:** Whether I’m on a walk, vibing to music, watching anime, or spending time with my loved ones, I’m all in. No more multitasking with my phone in one hand and half-paying attention. My focus has gone from meh to next level—I can actually sit and read or study for hours now.

5. **Me and My Phone = Healthy Boundaries:** My phone? It’s a tool now, not a time-suck. I only use it intentionally, and that little shift has made my days feel so much more productive and meaningful. Bonus: My anxiety and stress have plummeted.

6. **Stronger Connections:** I’ve gotten so much closer to the people around me. Conversations feel deeper, and those phone-free moments (especially before bed) remind me how special undistracted time really is.

7. **SO Much Extra Time:** Cutting my screen time has freed up so many hours of my life. I feel so much lighter, knowing I don’t have to carry my phone everywhere. Morning walks with my sister? Just vibes. No distractions, just enjoying the moment.

**Real Talk:**  
The past few months haven’t been all sunshine and rainbows. I’ve been struggling with some pretty tough depression, and during sleepless nights, my phone became a way to cope and quiet my dark thoughts. But the good news? I’ve slowly been getting back into my healthy sleep routine over the past few weeks. Progress is progress.  

Lastly, I want to thank my girlfriend for her unwavering support throughout this journey and Discipulus for writing that transformative article that made a huge impact on my life.",excited,Happy
"I still “chase” my partner. What about your relationship do you find thrilling? My comment in response to still “chasing” my long term partner:

“I chase my wife every day. I want her to be impressed by me, think I’m sexy, find me intellectually attractive, have feelings for me. We work at our relationship and that is a chase. It is thrilling to have your long term partner who knows everything about you to still get butterflies about you. I will chase that feeling from her every day I have.

"My parents finally try to accept me as a non binary person instead of a girl and I'm so happy about it! I came out to my parents about being non binary (AFAB) when I was 16, I've known it since I was 15 and rn I'm 20. So it's been a long time and I'm quite sure of myself about who I am and how I feel.
A few years ago my mom kept telling me that it was a phase and my dad even told me that I was just following a trend that that if I ever did anything to make my body appear less feminine then he won't consider me his child anymore... Other than that everything was great in my life.

But now my parents are suddenly trying to accept me!
I have no idea what changed but today my mom came to my room to give me some of my dad's old clothes, we're going to attend a wedding soon so I needed good clothes for that, and she gave me my dad's old suit!
I was so happy that for the first time she didn't ask me to wear a dress, and my dad accepted to lend me his old clothes for a formal event without trying to convince me to wear something else first😁😁😁
And when I tried everything on my mom looked at me and I could see all the love in her eyes and she just said ''you're becoming a beautiful person''
I almost cried, I'm french so we have a very binary language and she used the word joli/jolie which means beautiful but it sounds the same way no matter if it's masculine or feminine (unlike beau/belle), and she said person and not young woman as she usually did

I'M SO HAPPY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
They're both 50+ and they're actually trying to change how they acted and how they were raised (like considering anything LGBT+ just a young people trend) to accept me as me 🥰 I love them so much and I just want to share that joy with everyone and anyone right now 🥳❤️",excited,Happy

For the last few years I think I’ve been depressed. Things I used to enjoy didn’t feel the same or quickly became bland. But today I woke up feeling motivated to actually study for my exam. I felt this indescribable feeling that made me want to grin (something I’ve never felt in my 21 years of life. I also have a rbf). I realized that this must be what it feels like to be happy and I cried. I feel like a hyper puppy with all this energy and I just needed to share this moment with someone. ",excited,Happy

"I can’t believe how lucky I am to have found the most wonderful man  I’m so madly in love with the most wonderful man and I can’t believe someone could love me the way he does. 

He is the feeling of safety and contentment. I feel like my confidence has skyrocketed since we met. I’m not a particularly beautiful woman, but the way he talks about me you would think I looked like Margot Robbie or someone of that calibre. Even after a long day when my hair is a mess and my make up is sliding off my face and I’m in my comfy clothes he always tells me how beautiful I look, to the point where I’m actually starting to believe if about myself. 

I would do anything to keep him safe because I know that he is the best thing to ever happen to me and I want to be that for him too. I feel like I make such an effort for him and yet it feels like nothing at all because I want to do it for him. He’s had a hard life and I want to make him feel as if everything he went through was worth it because he has someone who loves him so dearly. 

I feel the most immense sense of gratitude and gratefulness that the universe has helped us find each other. Meeting him has made me understand the meaning of life, which is to love and to be loved.

I’ve never known happiness like this and I feel like I need the world to know.",excited,Happy

"Found a clinic that might be able to make having a baby a reality.  My husband has two perfect babies that were born before we met. He got a vasectomy after his daughter was born. We are very close and I’ve had them since they were very young. 

After about a year and a half of dating we decided we’d like a baby that belonged to both of us. Reversing a vasectomy is crazy expensive - about 10k which is just money we don’t have. 

I told myself if we weren’t able to start trying by next summer I’d pull the plug and be happy with the kiddos we have and be ok with freedom in our early 40s. 

We found a clinic charging about 3k for a reversal. I get a 3k bonus in June. Feels like fate. ",excited,Happy

"Open call to fill this thread with beautiful things about someone you wouldn't want to be without.  After I lost my dad I was blown away by all of the lovely things that people had said about him. Not because he wasn't all of those things, but just because nobody said them while he was alive. These days I make a concerted effort to tell the people in my life exactly how wonderful they are. 

This thread is a space for you to do just that. Even if they never see it - speaking positively about someone (even behind their back) is such a gorgeous habit to get into, and I reckon it makes you feel all warm and glowy too. So, get writing!
I'll start...

My boyfriend is slogging his way through the Alps with his best mate this week and he's got no phone signal. I'm so proud of him and so excited for his adventure, but I miss him like mad, and here's why:

He's so funny, he makes me laugh more than anyone else, he literally walks into the room and I light up. He's my best friend, and I love just chatting to him, listening to his thoughts and ideas and watching his face when he's excited or passionate about something. I love going climbing and hiking with him, watching him achieve and surpass his goals and sharing in his his joy when he overcomes a hurdle. I love the way his mind works and how he'll show me a new way of looking at things. I love it when he gets out of the shower and puts on one of my hugely oversized hoodies. He's interesting and curious and silly and spontaneous and thoughtful and kind and careful and generous and supportive and sexy and smart and playful and I legit think he's the coolest and I am so damn lucky to share my life with him.

"Had a fantastic first date, and can't stop thinking about it I have never had good luck when it comes to dating / relationships. I have been single since 2018 because I just didn't have the passion for it anymore.

This past friday I had a WONDERFUL first date. It included sushi, laughter, blushing, connections, things in common, and hugs. We've talked and texted every day since and have another date this weekend to go to an arcade and play some games. I haven't felt this way in ages and I wish this feeling for each and every person on planet earth. Wars would end, abuse would stop, and people would smile at each other all the time. I know it's only been one date, but even a chance at finding my person has made me feel warm on the inside. :) I love you all!",excited,Happy
"I reconnected with an online friend from 10 years ago I'm 22 years old. 10 years ago, little me made an online friend. We talked for hours everyday. 
I don't know what happened - life happened probably, but we lost contact. 

Time passed, and I always looked back on that - so weird that a single online friend from so long ago stuck with me so much. 

This week, I was able to reconnect with my friend! We were both really happy. She remembered me. In fact, from our conversation, she probably remembers more about that time than me! We talked for a couple of hours about anything and everything, and I was really surprised (and excited) to discover that we have a really similar way to look at life. 

She still lives on the other side of the world, but I hope to keep in touch and meet her one day. 
It's small things like this that make me think it's worth it.

PS: Hopefully my non-native English is okay. ",excited,Happy
"My niece took her very first steps today!! She just turned 1 last month! She’s staying with us for a couple days while my sister is out of town. She can already stand on her own without holding onto something, but it was a complete shock when she randomly just took like 5 or 6 steps all by herself out of nowhere. Yes i did cry before you ask lol ",excited,Happy

Old lady helped me get to the correct bus stop! I was going to work today and metro line stopped due to someone on the track. I decided to take a bus to work so I followed direction from google maps. I didn't know bus stop was moved to another location so I was just waiting when one lady saw me and cross the road just to tell me that bus stop has moved. She even came with me to make sure I go to the right stand. I had to write this because that's the first time some random stranger has shown kindness towards me.,excited,Happy

"I have lost a little over 30 pounds since February, pretty jazzed about it. 

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop.",excited,Happy
"My girlfriend bought me a bunch of flowers for my birthday and I couldn’t be happier! I (19M) turned 19 on Tuesday last week and my girlfriend (19F) made it so special for me.

"I found a new healthy coping mechanism and it makes me happy! I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for quite some time. Ive been okay for a while now but i have to be mindfull to keep it at bay, probably for the rest of my life. 

I can do it but recently i found a new one that 1) keeps the anxiety at bay 2) is good for me and 3) makes me happy! 

Sometimes music makes me overthing (lyrics) but omw to college and home everyday i want to keep my headphones on, definetly in the train and metro. So I started listening to an audiobook and it was the best thing ever. I laughed, i got emotional and loved every moment. 

Now I subscribed to an audiobook service and I get to listen to amazing stories wherever I go! I truly think this will have a huge impact on my mental health for the better. <3",excited,Happy
"My future in-laws are hosting a pre-wedding party for us. They also got me paprika from Hungary and the original cologne from Cologne after a trip to Europe.

"Cooked an Irish Guinness stew for ~8 hours today and it was a huge hit! It's very rare that everyone (me, wife, 5y and 7y) all go crazy for something.   The kids were inhaling it, and were on their third bowl before I could even sit down properly. 

Just a happy memory with the family, and I highly recommend this recipe! 
 
[https://www.recipetineats.com/irish-beef-and-guinness-stew/](https://www.recipetineats.com/irish-beef-and-guinness-stew/)

I added less beef and more bacon (as I was low on beef, definitely more beef next time!) and some leeks, but that's about it.  Served over a nice and buttery white rice, but potatoes would be awesome too.

It's a very forgiving recipe if you're looking for a nice slow cooked stew.  

Edit, oh and yeah the  ~3 minutes for the onion and garlic is a joke as usual for recipes.  I cooked them for at least 15 minutes on low/medium heat, and then another 15+ on medium/high with the bacon until they lost most of their water and got nice and brown. 

Cheers!",excited,Happy
"Does anyone else have a friend like this? I have a friend I only meet once a year. She always considered me as her best friend. We are both busy and we rarely have time to talk, but when we do get the chance it is so great. She will bring me some gifts. I will write letters for her. When we meet it is such a wonderful time because we both give ourselves fully to the present moment. The beauty of the relationship is in how much we are involved when we do meet. We talk and share stories with such joy. It feels as if we have a connection that goes beyond time and space. Every time we meet it is such a blast, and it doesn’t matter that we meet only once a year or so. 

I realised that the only valuable thing you can ever offer anyone is your time and attention. I notice such a difference when I do something with full involvement. In our relationship there are no expectations of anything. We just give ourselves, share our joy, and accept each other the way we are. 

I came across this quote by Sadh-guru that I resonated with. “If two people come together, it should be a sharing of joy, not extracting joy from each other.”",excited,Happy
"Sweet cashier at Home Depot complimented me  I’ve (21F) dealt with self esteem issues for the majority of my life, especially my teens. Even after I started working out vigorously, lost a lot of weight, shaped my figure and made my skin what others would call flawless, I still could never shake the feeling that I am ugly. 

I would and still get compliments from time to time, but I never fully believe them. I just think people are being nice. 

Husband and I went to Home Depot to get some duct tape to keep his trunk closed after a car accident. 

We go to check out and this sweet older lady looks at me while ringing us up. She says, “Are you 19 or 20?”

Me: Im actually 21! 

Her: You’re very beautiful. You have such nice skin. You must’ve taken very good care of it while you were younger. You don’t even need a lot of makeup like the other ladies cake it on. 

Me: Thank you 🥹. And you’re right ma’am. Im just wearing concealer and blush today

Her: You keep it that way. No point in covering that beautiful natural skin you have. (Turns to my husband) You have a very beautiful wife. You should feel lucky! 

Him: I do trust me hehe

Idk why but that made my day. I dont believe most compliments but I believed her for some reason. I knew she was being genuine. A small compliment actually helped me a lot today. 

I’ve been feeling uglier recently because my skin has been acting up due to pregnancy so I dont feel like it’s as nice as it used to be. Im also getting more freckles on my face which I hate. Once in a while I cover them with foundation.

So that lovely lady made me feel 1,000x better than I previously did. ",excited,Happy
"Every day is better than the one before :) I'm almost afraid to say anything, because I don't want to jinx it. Life has been so blissful. I secured sponsorship for an event/cause I truly care about. I have a job interview today that I'm very excited about. My beautiful home with my wonderful boyfriend is coming together in every way I imagined, and more. We work together so seamlessly. He literally built me an art room so I can get back to painting and creating. Our cats are sweet and happy. Even when I'm frustrated, or annoyed, because life's like that, he comes home and we just play and joke and everything brightens. I don't want to sleep,  because this is better than dreaming. I know things change and don't last forever, but damn today is a good day :) ",excited,Happy
"My birthday dinner was incredible and I had to share Prior post I spoke of how I felt I didn’t have a choice for my birthday. He could tell what I actually wanted. We got packed up to travel. We got dressed up. We went and picked up my favorite cake (tres leches). I took one bite (I ate much more later, so good). We went to Chinese. It was so incredible. They put us in the vip lounge. They brought me a birthday cake and candle as well. My boyfriend made it a perfect night. We came home and we watched YouTube together. Tomorrow we will play Genshin together. It’s been the most perfect birthday I’ve had in years. He made me feel so pretty, valued, loved and appreciated. He complimented me. He openly expressed to me. Just so grateful and in love. I had to tell someone. ",excited,Happy

"Did a few things. No one's told me they are proud of me though. But oh well.  1. Lost 4 kgs in 32 days. 
I hit rock bottom with 113.5 kgs but I have been consistent and mindful these days.
I have been trying really hard. I gain weight even by breathing but slowly I can see the scale tipping lighter. 
I am 109.4 kgs as of this morning. 🥳🥳
(P.s- I know I have a long long way to go but one day at a time)

2. Made healthier choices. 
Even when I became an emotional mess (harsh words were spoken and then it kinda gets stuck in my head playing in a loop), instead of binge eating like I usually do, I decided to choose healthy. Did not binge eat. Instead had my regular meal with a small slice of cake. 

3. Stopped beating myself up for that choice. 
Usually I would beat myself up for binge eating or even eating a slice of cake out of guilt or self loathing. I am trying to be kind to myself too. I deserve it. 

4. Tried cooking something healthy I saw on internet. Burnt it in my first 2 attempts but I guess 3rd time's really a charm. Got it right and it tasted delicious. 

So yeah. That's all. I hope you have a great day too. 🤗❤️",excited,Happy
"At school, people are finally noticing me more At school, I was doing saxophone practice by myself and so were this popular guy and his girlfriend and they commented on my saxophone skills which made my day but later in the day, the guy's girlfriend waved at me and in phys ed, the guy complimented my handball skills.

"Just told each of my friends and family I love them I woke up this morning in a good mood and wanted to share the love. So I started to message friends with heartfelt messages about how I appreciate them a lot and love them. Seeing how it made their day, I kept going through friends I'd been thinking of, those I hadn't seen in a while, and those who have heard it many times. Then I started messaging relatives, called my mom and dad, told my little brother, even some cousins I don't really conect with anymore but still appreciate. The responses varied a fair bit. Some people matched my energy, some had few words but I could feel their happiness, some just listened, and some deflected with jokes. I'm sure a cousin or two even laughed at me but I think even they appreciated it deep down. The people that had their day made really deserved it. They truly are great people that I'm delighted to see so happy. I'm just happy to speak honestly to each and every one of these people, to see their happiness, and to know that they all know I love them. It's really a peaceful feeling.",excited,Happy

"I'm happy to share my progress in gaining weight I'm really happy to share that I’m now 48 kg (I’m 5'4"" btw), since I was fluctuating between 43 and 44 throughout my teenage years. Now I can finally wear all the dresses I bought when I was 15 to 18 because I bought those dresses thinking one day I would be able to wear them and look good.

(According to the BMI) One more kg and I’ll be perfectly healthy and fine. Just to tell everyone how hard it was for me to gain weight, it took me 3 months to gain 1 kg this year.

Throughout my teenage years (I am 19 now and will turn 20 in November), I went through a lot of body shaming regularly by literally everyone I know, including my family, relatives, friends, and even my teachers.

I’m just glad that I made it through despite all the negativity people gave me. I know this is not much of a milestone, but I’m really happy that the efforts I put into myself are finally working. 

So to anyone who's working on themselves, never give up, just because you're not seeing the progress. The efforts you put in will work sooner or later. ",excited,Happy
"My husband and I just agreed to get matching tattoos for our wedding anniversary!  We’d been discussing getting matching tattoos for a while, but didn’t want to include each other’s names, and we both like incredibly different styles. I love minimal, small tattoos. He likes realistic tattoos. We also didn’t plan on getting the same tattoo - I’m getting a sun because I’m his sunshine and he’s getting a moon because he’s the light in my darkness. I sketched up a quick design idea for my sun. The longer to shorter lines to will be a subtle M M (his initial). This way, I’d get the style I like! We then looked at moon tattoos, and he plans to get a realistic moon in the moon phase on the night of our wedding! He wants to have it framed by leaves weaved together from my favorite plants 😍 we plan on getting them on our left sides to represent our marriage. I’m so excited and feel so lucky to have him!! 💖💖",excited,Happy

"My mother in law and I planned a sneaky surprise for my future sister in law and I really hope she likes it! My absolute angel of a mother in law and I are taking my future sister in law to a little tea house as surprise! We just told her to be ready to go at a certain time and have sworn all the boys to secrecy 😊. 

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life! 

So here's to a sneaky surprise!  *shush* no telling!🤫

"This year has been the best year of my life so far, after i've felt like nothing worked out for me for so long. I feel like i just need to type this out because i'm almost exploding with happiness lately

This year so far has been the best i've ever had. I've always struggled with myself due to things that happened when i was young, the most crippling thing being fear of failure. But the past couple of years, i've worked so hard to overcome that, and even though it's still sometimes hard, i am currently reaping the rewards of so many improvements i've made over the years!

My aspirations to become a DJ have taken off since the start of the year. Also, me and a couple of friends who started an event organisation have succesfully organised a multitude of parties already, even hosting international artists, something i could have only dreamt of two years ago. Me and my girlfriend celebrated our one year anniversary. we've also enjoyed a couple of holidays that we wanted to go on together, as we really like to travel. Something i haven't been able to do in YEARS.

I feel like everything is suddenly just.. working out. After feeling like nothing could ever go right for me for years, it all suddenly turned around and i could not be more thankful. My new girlfriend i want to marry, the insanely talented, hardworking, and positive people in my network, the things i've been able to do that i've dreamt of for so long, it's happening in front of my eyes, I need to pinch myself at times",excited,Happy
"I have good friends who I can hug now :'] I (15M) recently got into a new friend group after leaving my old one because they were assholes. These new friends are respectful and understanding and I can open up to them like I did with my online friends. I feel like I've never had a true friend irl until now. 

And the best part of it all... 
THEY GIVE ME HUGS!! ;D
I got ELEVEN hugs his week :O 
And they were good long hugs too. I don't think I've ever had one of those nice long hugs before until now that I'm getting them almost every day :'>

I'm so happy that my goal of getting hetter friends worked out so well. I didn't expect it to happen so soon either. I thought I would be in university already, still struggling to form that close bond with someone irl. But no, it took less than 2 months after leaving my old friends and only hanging out with the ones that treated me with respect and here I am :]

I wish everyone could have what I have and be hugged every day by their good friends some day if they wanted to. Good luck guys :)",excited,Happy

  Got back and he's going strong in a helldivers match and I head to the bedroom intent to lounge till he's ready for breakfast. I look up from sitting on the bed as he runs to the doorway, peaks at me around the edge and runs in the room leaping onto me like a spider monkey and kissing me deep.

It's been years without a real, proper clean, and when I unrolled it I could actually smell how bad it was. So that's gotta mean the rest of the house is getting cleaner and smelling better and I'll be way better at detecting those smells moving forward!

"Realized that I will always succeed in finding happiness Even though sometimes I mess up or fail at something, like not finishing a project, or falling behind on good habits, I'm always going to be able to bounce back.

A lot of people who struggle mentally say it's because they find comfort in instability. I think I've finally broken that. I feel absolutely no comfort in a messy environment, or skipping a meal, or leaving art unfinished. I'm programmed to want the best for myself and I will ALWAYS return to that as my primary goal, no matter how much I struggle.

Today I felt really demotivated as I have a lot of stuff on my plate right now and I guess I've been mentally processing some past events a bit. But I made myself some tea and stood outside watching the rain from my porch, and I looked up at the sky and the trees that surrounded my house and I just felt so great. It was around 6pm and the rain was super heavy and the light from the sky and the porch lights reflecting off the ramp was just stunning. The warm lighting inside the house was gorgeous. How could I ever stay sad for too long when I can find something so beautiful literally in my own house? And what does that say about the beauty in the entire world, when MY house of all houses, messy as all hell because I'm in the midst of a MUCH needed deep clean, can look like that?

I started a bucket list too, and the first thing I put on it is that I wanna see stars in person. Somewhere with no light pollution where I can REALLY see them.

I'm not any specific kind of religious, I engage in certain practices and if anything I worship myself, but just seeing space from earth even in pictures and videos, it makes sense why ancient people started believing in a god.",excited,Happy
"In July 2022, after being sick starting in early childhood and eventually accumulating 8 autoimmune diagnoses, I was finally properly diagnosed with a really complicated immune disease. It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!",excited,Happy
"Just submitted an assignment and it made me reflect on how good my life's been lately  Funnily enough I've been experiencing some mild depression. But even that feels chill because its December,  me and my flatmate aren't talking right now and it's assignment week so it all makes sense.

My assignment was really good. I had terrible tech problems uploading it but I felt minimum stress about it. 

I'm half way through my degree now. I love my job and once I qualify I'll be on good money. I'm finally debt free and managed to save 5k this year. My relationship with my family is healing. I finally found a physio who could help with my chronic pain. My dog is cute. My friends are great. I've finally learned to stand up for myself. My therapist thinks I don't need to keep going. 

I'm so proud of myself. I don't want to go on about it to people itl but I just needed to share",excited,Happy
"I am blessed with some of the most wonderful women in my life Back in 2022, I was in a pretty bad place. I ended a relationship that was fruitless, and I was working a job where I felt awkward and lonely due to most of my coworkers not speaking my language. Then, a little over a month after I ended my first relationship, a young woman left a review on a fanfic I posted. I thanked her for her review, and she responded back to me. One thing led to another, and though I wasn't sure if she was romantically attracted to me, at one point, I felt like we were meant to be together, so I told her that I'd never wanted anyone more than her, and our relationship was cemented. I love her because she's not only passionate about the things she does, but she shows such girly enthusiasm. Our relationship hasn't been perfect, but we've been able to resolve any differences we had, and being with her has assured me that good relationships are worth the effort.

Fast forward to 2023. I made a post on another site comparing a couple of my favorite fictional characters, and another young woman responded to it. I responded back to her, she responded back to me, and we went back and forth for a bit before we connected on Discord. She also introduced me to the concept of platonic love, which confused me at first, but I grew to love having someone else who was more than a friend, but not quite my girlfriend. We've even adopted each other as brother and sister. Like my girlfriend, we don't always agree, and she too has had her own issues to deal with, but being there for her makes me feel happy.

Between these two women, my mother and some of my other friends who are women, I feel blessed to have them in my life.",excited,Happy

"My wholesome best friend gave me money to afford a game we want to play together  So, basically I had 1€ in my bank account, a d my best friend transfered the remaining 5 to me, because we wanted to play a game together that was on sale. I'm so grateful and happy. I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

"Broke my leg but it gave me hope in society. Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all.",excited,Happy
"Saved a friend from a disastrous real estate transaction. There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses.",excited,Happy
"My sweet boyfriend gift me this today <3 Its hard to see everything but he got me fake sunflowers (that's what he calls me 🌻🥹) the cute halloween plush, halloween lights, 2 kombuchas, chocolates, a boyfriend hoodie (he sprayed his cologne on it), and a cute cauldron mug. We are also celebrating Thanksgiving together twice. Safe to say I have so so much to be grateful for 🌈 I've also got a Halloween gift for him that I'm saving for then. Being in love is so wholesome.

"I've been feeling loved and accomplished these past weeks   I've come from feeling lonely to feel cherished by the people around me. My friends regularly ask me to hang out, they include me in things and love my personality just how it is. My dad was talking proudly about me the other day and we have quality time moments sometimes. My relationship with my mother, which used to be strained, is getting better, we don't fight as much. The other day we were talking, like usual, but I just felt a very soft energy from her, like I could trust her with stuff and that she wouldn't just suddenly change her mood. Her eyes looked kind, I don't know. Today I was hanging out with a friend and I noticed she had a picture of me and her on our birthday, we share the birthday and celebrate together with friends since we were 6, on her clear phone case. That made me happy.

  I've been spending less time on social media, I finally like my appearance, for most of the time. I'm restarting old hobbies, I'm stopping the very high expectations on myself. I live day to day, I take pride in drinking enough water and walking step by step towards my goals. I don't need to be the best of all, I only need to keep putting effort and to keep being better than yesterday. I have everything I desired 2 years ago. Everything I wanted and hoped for is happening.

  Sorry for the long rant, I've been feeling pretty happy these past weeks. ",excited,Happy
"Got approved for my first apartment today! I didn’t think I made enough money but I submitted my documents and they said I make way more than the qualifying amount. This is my first big adult real-life payment, and I’m so excited to move in. It’s an awesome place. ",excited,Happy
"I’m so happy I’m in a relationship where I can openly discuss my desires for the future  I was in a lot of dead end relationships, often for too long because I would hope beyond hope that I was worth building a future with. In my last relationship, he would shut down the moment I brought up marriage or children. 

I’m almost a year in with my boyfriend now, and while we did have a brief conversation about the future when we first met (yes to marriage, potentially to children) but last night we were laying in bed holding each other and discussing potentially fostering/adoption once we buy a house together, in 5+ years. It feels so natural to have these talks with him, I don’t feel ashamed for wanting these things. 

I’m just riding the high of feeling like my partner and I are on the same page and want the same things. ",excited,Happy
"I have a story about a really sweet guy. So this mid 30’s? gentelman on the bus to the airport today was on the phone with who I assume was his girlfriend (he was right beside me talking loud; I wasn’t eavesdropping; it was as if he wanted everyone to hear) and he said “I know you’re about to take a nap but when you called me and sang Stevie Wonder ‘I just Called to Say I Love You’ to me, I really needed that, you can’t imagine how big the smile was on my face as I was in a shitty situation at work.”

That’s one of the sweetest things I’ve ever heard. Made me smile.

I thought that was beautiful :)",excited,Happy
"Celebrating the first effects of my healthier lifestyle  Over the last 2 months I worked a routine into my daily life that includes me walking or cycling 5-10km. That together with limiting soda heavily and being more mindful of what I eat made me feel more fit.

"I helped a kid start their own Pokemon collection Today I was out looking for those small rectangular Pokemon tins because I collet: the stickers, pokemon index cards, and redeem the QR codes. Any special cards like the EX, V, Vstar, Full Art etc, I also collect. The normal cards I get I give to my friend who in return gives me their QR cards.

Anyway, while I was out I came across a mother and her son. They were there first, and while I was looking through the in-store stock the mother asked if I collect Pokemon cards. I of course said yes, and she asked for advice about starting a collection for her son. I asked about the budget and if it was a collection to play or a collection to look at. It's the boy's birthday, he wants to collect to look at and he had a $100 birthday budget.

I briefly explain the pros and cons of the packs, tins and battle decks. I recommended the single packs, packs with the figures, and tins as the son just wants to collect to look at them rather than play. The packs (and pack with figures / in tins) are randomized whereas Battle Decks are not. But if or when he ever gets into wanting to play the game I would recommend getting a battle deck but it's not necessary if he learns through other people / videos of how to create his own deck.

They end up choosing 2 of those packs with figures (a Gengar figure and I think the other was Bellibolt) and one of the Mini Pokemon binders that holds 40 cards. A good combo to start with.

Once they have their things they thank me, I respond with ""You're welcome"" and ""Happy birthday"" to the son. We go our separate ways after that. It honestly made my day.",excited,Happy
"My brother is such a smartmouth, and I love him When I was a kid, my brother and I grew up mostly apart. Our parents separated when I was 4, and he was newborn. Why isn't relevant.. We grew up on different continents, with my dad military, and my mum in the US. We fought as kids like cats and dogs. Blood was almost a guarantee if we were left unsupervised for ANY period of time. We have both left scars on each other from our time as little shits full of spite. 

As someone who traveled frequently, I got hooked on pokemon at an early age. TO keep things fair, if a pokemon game was bought, it meant BOTH games were bought. IE, I got gold, so he got silver. I got sapphire, so he got ruby. I got diamond, so he got pearl, etc. Except I always had the luck of getting the game that had Growlithe. He always got the game that had Vulpix. 

Whenever I would go to spend time with our mum... I would steal his game/gameboy. Only for a little bit, to catch a shit ton of vulpix and trade them to my game. He absolutely -hated it-. because i would spend all his currency on pokeballs and send twenty or thirty vulpix to my own game, leaving him with a box full of random trash starter-area normals. 

  
As adults (we're now both in our thirties), we're super close. He's one of my best friends, and we talk regularly both via text and call. So when he found out our mum was coming to visit and he couldn't come with, he gave her a small box to give to me. She gave me the caveat that he handed it to her with the SWEAR ON HIS LIFE that it wasn't mean.... so if it was, it wasn't her fault, she took it with good faith.  
  
y'all, I died when I opened that box. Holographic ninetails from one of the original runs, near mint, with an appraisal certificate. 

Now I can ""stop stealing \[his\] shit"".

  
Fucking love him so much, it's no wonder my spouse has a smart mouth and more sasss than I can cope with. <3 I guess I just need that sass in my life.",excited,Happy

" From Rock Bottom to Pure Bliss: Overcoming Addiction, Trauma, and Finding New Joys in Life 
A year ago, my life felt like a never-ending nightmare. I was struggling with addiction, grieving the loss of someone deeply important to me, and feeling utterly stuck—no job, no school, and no hope for the future. On top of it all, in one of my lowest moments, I narrowly survived a brutal attack from someone that I was friends with for 10 years. It almost ended my life. It felt like life was hell-bent on breaking me.

Fast forward to today, and I hardly recognize that person. I’m back in school, working a job I never imagined I’d be able to get, and-I rescued a stray cat who turned out to be pregnant. Now, I have a little fur family of six that brings me endless joy and love. And as if things couldn’t get better, I’m about to marry my best friend and embark on my dream honeymoon.

It’s been a wild, painful, and beautiful journey, and I’m incredibly grateful to be here today, living a life I never thought was possible. If you’re struggling, just know things can turn around in ways you can’t even imagine. ",excited,Happy
"I am engaged to my long distance partner of 3.5 years I’m engaged to my LDR partner

I have been dating my LDR partner for 3.5 years, for simplicity sake we’ll refer to her as Sun, because on dark days she sure as hell lights my life up.

This passed Monday it was her 27th birthday along her twin brother and Nieces birthday, and after 3.5 years I decided to make the international trip to see her for her birthday, I’ve known for a long time now that I want to marry her, however I did not have the ring or the financial means at the moment that I wanted to propose, so I decided to wait.

The morning after the shared birthday I told her I’d love to do a photoshoot with just the two of us, and we went onto the beach that was connected to the resort we were staying at, which was pure beauty, she agreed and asked her sister to take our photos, so we go down and the three of us are doing our photoshoot when her sister asks, do you guys have any other poses, Sun didn’t but I had one in mind, so I said as much, 

Then before Sun had realised it I took the ring off of my finger that my Dad had given me, this ring held such sentimental value to me that it only seemed right to sit as a stand in until we get her the ring she would eventually call her engagement ring.

I dropped to one knee and I asked her to marry me, she was surprised and took a second to process everything happening before she jumped up and down and started giggling out of excitement and she said yes!

The next day after we returned to the hotel we were staying at for the majority of the trip we went to the mall nearby, and began the hunt for her ring, I wanted to spend a lot on her ring to display how much I valued her no matter what but she said she doesn’t want anything expensive she already has everything she needs and we found her ring at a stand in the mall, she chose it and it looks beautiful on her hands,

Today is Thursday now and we’ve been engaged since Tuesday the 22nd of October, I love my fiancée and while we still have an incredibly long road ahead of us, including immigration and wedding planning, I just know that she will be an amazing wife, mother and partner as we both go on through our lives together, 

Thank you reddit for reading my story, I’m just so god damn happy!",excited,Happy
"I got a new kitten 2 days ago, and a new hobby on top... ...and he's the cutest boy ever. A rescue, only one surviving from his litter. And we are already big friends! Here he is, completely knocked out after playing and dinner, but fishing for more pets. Love the lil guy already! And he is so courageous, given the rescue got him at 1 day old and he's never seen stuff like beds, TV and all these human things. He takes it all with such a curious mind, it is so inspiring! Can't wait for him to meet my older boy too, as soon as he is settled in comfortably. 

In addition I joined the rescue he is from, made new friends and now help alleviate cat misery. I have lived with cats for 35 years, time to give back and get more cats to loving homes! 

I was quite down a while ago, looking for something that makes me feel really useful in this world, but I think we are on a good way now :)",excited,Happy

My mother told me what happened in a recent conversation. 

A few days ago, he was recognized for his lifetime of service to the club. In his very succinct acceptance speech he said, ""I'd like to that the board for this kindness, but this award is really for my wife.  James Taylor said it best, 'How sweet it is to be loved by you.'""

I wasn't there to witness it, but the collective gasp by those in attendance was a sight to behold. Other people who were on hand to accept trophies were literally crying.",excited,Happy

It’s humid and rainy and I’m drenched in sweat, but it’s just kinda peaceful and nice.

"I think I finally made it out of the trenches Idk if this is the right category or whatever to post this in, I don’t really use Reddit much lol. Anyway, this past year I’ve had some pretty severe depression, I’ve lost multiple friends this year, my best friend, I was kinda thinking about taking an easy way out, I felt I couldn’t talk to anybody but my best friend who I had known for 5 years, which she ended up making things worse in the end. I didn’t sleep for weeks straight, I only got a few hours. I usually spent my time crying and wallowing in my own shame and self pity til the sun came up. 

But this past about month I’ve been extremely happy, idk if it’s bc school is out, and I have some free time, or what but I actually wake up happy and get more than a few hours of sleep. I talk with my friends and me new friend every day sometimes we talk all day long, we play video games, talk about  plans for next year anything. Me and my dad a getting along great, I’m going to see my grandma and family I haven’t seen for years soon, i couldn’t ask for more honestly. 

Every once in a while I start to feel a tad bit sad, or discontent, but it usually goes away in a few minutes. Which is rare for me haha. I know not many people care, but I’m just very happy about things finally changing after what feels like forever, and it feels great to be happy. it feels like I forgot what it felt like, yknow?

Anyways thank you to anyone who read this, I hope y’all stay safe and keep at it. ❤️",excited,Happy

"I love my ""it's complicated"" so much it makes me want to cry. I met a guy recently at a boy scout camp and we get along perfectly.

Everything about him(17m) makes me(17m) so happy. The way i hold his hand by grabbing his middle & ring fingers and wrapping my index finger around his, his squishy physique, the way he almost completely covers me when we hug, his laugh, how easily he can pick me up, how he always comments on how small i am (i'm 5'4) compared to him (he's 5'9) and how small my hands are...
but what really gets me is how unashamed he is of himself, he loves being himself, and he acts just like me sometimes. He's the reason i've started dancing again because he danced with me, he laughs with me, he waved at the security camera in the store and for the first time ever in my life i did too. he got me to actually play games outside, so that's even more energy he brought back in my life.

I even love the less ""attractive"" things about him. sometimes he'll do gross stuff or show me gross stuff just to see the look on my face, i'm just as gross so it's not that bad but... ew, i love him i guess. Also he's a little dumb sometimes, but not stupid. (biiig difference)

he said he found me cute immediately, which makes me feel a little bad because it took me a few hours to realize how hot he is, but that's okay.

I honestly couldn't see my life without him anymore, he broke me out of my shell for the first time since i was a wee lad, and i wish i could give him something as good as that.",excited,Happy

"I had a positive, never before felt emotion today  It was happy. Something made me laugh, but I got this feeling that was really interesting and very strange.

I experienced it in slow motion. Ok what is this guy on? Nothing.. just coffee.

I thought of something funny.

The thought made me exhale, and at the bottom of my lungs, just as I was transferring between exhale to inhale. I got a really, really strange euphoria that completely filled me with wonder. 

It wasn't funnier than anything usual, but it still, for some reason, caused a feeling similar to one other experience in my life. 

There is a part of my head responsible for worry. It's always running. When I get home, when I'm on vacation, the weekend, even when I sleep. I can wake up before my alarm every day because I'm in a constant state of worry. My most frequently asked question is what time is it.

This part of my head has shut off two times, ever, and only recently. I had no idea this could be possible. The feeling was so peaceful that I have this eerie suspicion it's at least similar to the peace described in death. It reminded me of being a child and thinking eternal life was true. No concept of time, no need for it, or anything. 

Let me get to the point. This was one of those times. There was this strange elongated moment of euphoria in the transition between exhalation and inhalation. (AIR DAMNIT). I had forced the air out forcefully from laughter and running out of air with so much positive emotion made this worry section of my brain shut off for just a moment. And this has my attention.

This is such a drastic change it is kind of alarming. I don't think it is normal to have such a drastic change in...mood, outlook, attitude, all at once and so fast. It seems too unstable to me. It's positive so I'm not terribly worried, but I digress. I have been happy for a long time now. A year or so. I really want to get to the bottom of it, because if I can recreate it safely, I could find what I feel is peace.

Good morning north America yes I had my coffee today it was good. I hope everyone is good too. ",excited,Happy

"I'm in my first healthy relationship and I'm over the moon I'm so happy. I'm a 30 yo man, been in 5 long(ish?) relationships so far and now for the first time in my life I'm starting to learn what love actually is. How it looks like. How it FEELS like. How it acts and understands. 

We met in march, I got out of a 2.5 years long relationship in September last year, a very toxic and abusive one, the worst I've ever had.
When we (me and my current gf) met i didn't want any relationships for at least a year, I wanted to give myself time to heal and be ready for a relationship again. 

When we met I was looking for red flags all over the place. I couldn't find anything. Instead I felt at peace, calm, heard, understood. I felt like she actually cares about and wants to hear what i have to say. It felt so calming, so nice. I was really at peace with her that day. We laughed and played like kids on the street, had deep talks, shared experiences. When she hugged me after 6 hours of being together i just felt... Idk, like some kind of vibration down my spine? I didn't want that hug to end.

And then i realized how i felt and I unconsciously started pushing her away for the next two months and we went back and forth from texting to no contact. 
She was extremely understanding of the mess that I was. She didn't push or force anything.
After two months I told her why i am the way I am and she said she wants to give us a try. 

Now, 3 months in I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. My nervous system is at peace like it's never been before. We're healing each other. We listen, we talk, we communicate, we appreciate and respect each other. I feel seen, heard, loved for who I really am. It's so easy to open up to her like I never did before. She's my safe place, my happy place. My freedom. 
And she says she feels absolutely the same. 

I thought that I won't be able to navigate a relationship that's so healthy, so complete but... It's SO EASY. So easy that at times I'm confused, how something like this is even possible? 

I know I'm going to marry her, I even feel like I knew from that first day. I feel deep in my core that she is my soulmate and I'm so happy.

"All 2024 Resolutions Have Been Completed and Showing Promise! In 2024, my New Year's resolution was to truly focus on achieving my goals. I made some big changes: I moved out of my expensive apartment, left my toxic job, distanced myself from unsupportive people, started genuinely trying in uni (and I've come to enjoy my studies), stopped vaping, and began exercising and eating better. I've also been writing more than ever, determined to pursue my dream of becoming a scriptwriter. This past week has been proof that good things are on the horizon!

After four months of unemployment while searching for that 'big girl' job, I finally landed one last week! At just 21, I’m now working part-time for an international company, that's based in California, specializing in marketing and sales for its product launch in Australia. The team seems incredibly fun, and I’m being paid well. My office, still surreal to say, has a stunning view of Sydney from 43 floors up!

The next day, I found out I’m getting a HUGE tax return.

That same day, one of my professors mentioned that she had written two scripts for a TV show. I asked her about it, and she sent me tons of helpful resources on breaking into the industry, which was amazing since I’ve been feeling lost on how to network.

The day after that, I discovered that I’m going to New York for Christmas with three of my best friends—something I’ve dreamed of for years and can now afford thanks to my new job!

To top it all off, I found out that I've been accepted for my dream exchange program in Madrid, and with my tax return, I can do a huge Euro trip at the end of that semester!

Anything is possible. Don't give up! The easier route will always be there, but if you want something badly enough, you can make it happen!

I really don't like bragging which is why I am posting on here, but I am just so proud of myself and wanted to share that with the world.",excited,Happy
"Birthdays are my favorite time of the year Birthdays are so special to me. I've never had a lot of friends so my family was always the one to congratulate me first. And just like always, they wished me this year too. 

Birthdays are never a surprise in our home, more like a anticipated celebration being decorated right in front of our eyes. I was playing on my console, not really paying attention to the game but rather the clock ticking towards midnight. My mom was setting up the cake on the table and I pretended I didn't notice. As the clock hit 12 AM, my dad kept his hand on my shoulder, kissed my forehead wished me a happy birthday. 

My parents sang me the birthday song and we took some pictures as we cut the cake, and my mom kissed my cheek. I felt like I was 8 years old again. That same clapping noise and that same tune...for a moment there, I forgot all my worries and stresses. It was just us and this happy day. Overwhelmed, I couldn't help but tear up a bit. 

Just wanted to share that. Hold close the ones that you love dearly because they're really all you have at the end of the day. ",excited,Happy

She said she wants to read Prisoner of Azkaban as that is her favorite, I told her that is also one of my favorites except that that one does not have Voldemort in it! She also mentioned the upcoming TV series which I am NOT looking forward to! But thats okay! Oh god I wish me and her could chat about HP all day long! ",excited,Happy
"i finally decided i’m going to go to the gym with my friend and i couldn’t be more excited  so for the longest time i was against going to the gym, the grunting, the sweat, men, it’s just not a place i see myself liking to be around. i have really bad social anxiety and i don’t really have any body issues, i mean sometimes im astounded by the amount of space i take up, but overall im very happy with how i look. im not going to the gym for any physical reason other than the fact i have like hip pain and my doctor told me exercise should help. im pretty young (18) so joint and muscle pain shouldn’t be something im dealing with yet here i am. i’m mostly going to help with anxiety, i struggle a lot from generalized anxiety and medical anxiety and ocd tendencies. (woops) so it finally feels good to take care of myself in a way i can control. i’m also excited to be more socially attractive. i’m thinking of this as like a revenge body but for my past self, like my past self would be so upset i caved and im going to start working out. 

i will say i have no idea how to work out or do anything at the gym, i think im just gonna stair master and do the leg thing until im bored. i’ll probably ask my friend what to do, he’s a physical trainer. idk, im just excited to be going in the first place. i’m gonna take progress pics obviously because i wanna see how i look in a year.y main issue as of right now is that i dont know what to wear to the gym, i dont have any athletic pants nor do i want any, texture issue, do i just get sweatpants? i dont have any, would it be cringe to go in pajama pants? who’s to say! i may go in jeans, the world is my oyster, and it’s 2 in the morning. goodnight!

I, 24f got employed into a good paying job this year after struggling on a low income for years. My boyfriend has always been so thoughtful with his Christmas gifts and I have always wanted to return the favour by getting something he will truly love.

Well, with my new salary, I have been able to save up enough to buy him the lego lord of the rings eye of sauron tower. I'm genuinely so happy and cannot wait to see his reaction when he opens it.

"Hit 60 days in my mental health journal!!! Hit 60 days in my journal!!!!

So I have this journal that I write in, every day, because my mental health and depression was and still is slightly horrible. Just got off a caffeine addiction as well, so the journal helps me with my thoughts and stuff and how I feel, if I don't wanna divulge to my online or irl friends.

Well tonight, I just ended up hitting 60 days, which is farther than I ever thought I'd get! I struggled some days cause i had to hide it (i have a SNEAKING suspicion my grandma has been reading it while I'm at school) but i am proud of myself for how far I've gotten!!

the last few years of my life have been some of the worst, i’ve been going through a pretty bad depression, social anxiety and just an overall lack of direction in life or faith in myself. my sister, her husband and kids have been such a light in my life and i am SO incredibly lucky to have them as my family forever. it’s just such a comforting thought to know that i get to see the boys grow up, see my sister grow into a new type of motherhood, and be there for it all. i get to have such amazing family, and they’re here forever. how lucky am i!",excited,Happy
"My rescue Chigi, Chogie, is the cutest! He was so timid and fearful just a few weeks ago but now he is a happy boy and he makes us so happy too! 
I adopted Chogie, a few weeks ago, for my daughter's birthday. It also happens to me mine, my boyfriend's and my other dog, Captain Picard's birthday. Now we have one more thing to celebrate, next year.

He's already learned to sit, lay down, stand up and walk on his hind legs, jump 5 feet in the air, when I say jump, fetch, go outside and go in his kennel on command. I also found him 8 feet up the tennis court fence earlier, chasing a lizard. This adorable boy has talent and discipline and he's such a good boy!

When I first got him, the previous owner said he hated his kennel but it was just too small for him to want to be in. I used an in-between size (big enough to turn around) for about 10 days, while potty training and then got him this larger one (because sometimes I do need to put him somewhere safe) and he loves going in his kennel now.

He was super meek and not playful at first but he's in full puppy mode now! Awwwww! 

He's wearing a seatbelt-friendly dog harness I crocheted for him. I love my Chogie!",excited,Happy

"Sometimes hitting your lowest point is a necessary evil! Hit my lowest point ever a few months ago. Went out to the train tracks to end it all, not gonna lie. The cause was the ending of a five year relationship, naively thinking that they were the 'one' and all that junk. 

What saved me, and is keeping me going, is... the various friends I made along my healing journey (seriously, both new and old friends really stepped up to help), discovering awesome new hobbies (photography, boxing, fishing, etc), rediscovering the joy in old hobbies (cycling, foraging, language learning, etc), learning to love myself, helping others (got stuck focusing all my love on one person), becoming more involved in my community, and just letting go of my frustrations and anxieties and just living in the moment! 

And... the cherry on top is that I ended up meeting this pretty awesome friend who I'm, honestly, relating to and vibing with. Life is like ""hey, you're doing great with self love and healing, here's your reward: a friend who is almost identical to you, enjoy!"" Hahahaha so awesome! 

Looking forward to being done with university next year and being able to live a happy and fulfilling life :) and so many other dreams and goals to look forward to!",excited,Happy

I made a post in r/r4r as a last ditch effort one night when I was sad and I found the best of the best and we're official! Story in caption! 💜 The day me and this cutie met irl, we were supposed to go on our first date. Instead, I totalled my car 2 hours from home and 2 hours away from him (I'm ok!). He drove all the way to get me from the tow shop, drove to my hotel and stayed with me so I wouldn't be suffering alone because lawd I was some pain from being jarred so hard! Despite the dramatic start, our second date weekend was amazing!

"6 months clean from heroin today. A better life is possible! I posted something in this sub a little less than 6 months ago after being clean for 2 weeks (I deleted the post for unrelated reasons) and while I got a lot of support I also got a lot of crap because it was ""only two weeks, come back when you have actually achieved something"".  Well, [here I am](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDd7cMS), 6 months later, still clean, recently engaged, just got into a computer programming program, and have never been happier.  I just resolved my legal issues last week, actually have a savings of more than $2K, am rebuilding relationships with my family members and have nothing but optimism and hope for the future I never bothered to think about before.

"I'm 47 and just got a college degree this weekend 🎓 Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new.",excited,Happy

"Had a date over for dinner and woke up with a new girlfriend I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

This year I’ve been sick and haven’t seen her yet, but I found a very cool vintage Greenbay jacket. She’s a cheesehead so I know she’ll love it, but I need to add my flair, and I want to stick things in the pockets that she won’t find until she’s wearing it. There are 6 pockets. She’s a Mormon lady so the cruder the better. And they could be “Me” themed since that’s been the theme for years… ideas please!!",excited,Funny

"The story of Jeff I foster cats. Pretty much only have females, but holds true I normally get the difficult cats, they tend to be the girls.

I had ONE male foster and was an absolute dear. Just a big fluffy orange, and very orange. He was so handsome, but very daft.

I do remember it was food time and we have 3 other cats going to the bowls.

..and there he is. Just woken up, a big bunch of floof in the middle of the lounge floor. Yawning. ""Hey, food, laundry!""

The look of panic! And of course, I have tiles. 

Fat cats don't accelerate well on tiles. He made it to empty bowls, after running into the kitchen cabinet.

Jeff was a bit shocked  by this development, apparently, there was not a cabinet there before. Being orange he hisses at it and completely forgot about the mission.

The mission is food! So I politely ask ""you okay bud?"" He licks his leg, looks up at me..

I'm thinking, you have forgotten, haven't you. So again I ""food!"" (By this time the girls have completely polished off all the food and are now searching out sunny spots).

Food Jeff! Jeff! Oh! So, back to the scramble. Well, there's a problem, there's a cat door. He is on point though, squeezes through like my wife on *redacted* 

There's nothing in the bowls., and he howls at me like a banshee. I'm like buddy..

After that, I picked the idiot up and put him down in the laundry for food. So orange 🧡 and that is the story of Jeff, yes, his name was Jeff and he lived  in his own little cat world.",excited,Funny

He gets to the front of the queue and the teller asks him to counter-sign the check. He does so. The teller asks him for his SSN. He replies something like 8XQ84N. The teller says that is not a valid SSN. 'It most certainly is my SSN' he says. The teller says he can't cash it because it's not an American SSN. His reply '**Mate, if your brains were dynamite, you couldn't blow your ears off - I've already counter-signed it per your instructions and now I can't cash it anywhere else**'. He said it loud. Those within hearing distance were laughing - hard. The manager of the bank finally cashed it, but damn, that was a funny trip.",excited,Funny

Alright, folks, settle in! Let's talk about movies for a minute, will ya? Before all this other depressing crap in the news gives us a collective aneurysm. Let's talk about... Jurassic Park! I mean, are we still falling for this? After thirty years – THIRTY! – we're still lining up, paying good money, to watch these giant damn lizards munch on idiots. And we call it entertainment!

The first time, okay, you figure, ""Alright, the thrill of science, progress, the dream of some rich old bastard with more money than sense."" Hammond, right? With that little white beard, looking like a cut-rate Santa Claus, only instead of bringing presents, he brings a T-Rex to your goddamn garden party. ""Spared no expense!"" he says. You can say that again, you old fool! You spared no expense on anything except a fence that could actually hold a pissed-off poodle, let alone a prehistoric killing machine!

And then, the brilliant idea! ""Let's recreate dinosaurs!"" But why? Seriously, why? They were doing just fine being extinct, weren't they? Peaceful. Making fossils. Nobody was busting their chops. But noooo! Some scientist, probably having a mid-life crisis, instead of buying a sports car, decides to play God with a mosquito stuck in amber. ""You know what? Let's bring 'em all back! What could possibly go wrong?"" EVERYTHING! Everything could go wrong, you over-educated, gel-haired moron!

And sure enough! Like clockwork, the T-Rex busts out. What am I even telling you this for? It's a mathematical certainty! More reliable than death and taxes! ""We've got the most powerful electric fences in the world! Motion sensors! Infrared!"" And ZAP! The power goes out! Are you kidding me? Every single goddamn time, the power goes out? Did you try paying the electric bill, you cheapskates? Or maybe the T-Rex took an online course in electrical engineering, what the hell do I know?

And the people! Oh, the people! After the first movie, you'd think, ""Okay, lesson learned."" Not a chance! They make a second, a third, a fourth... Jurassic World! Jurassic Universe! Jurassic Goddamn Cleveland! And people still go! They line up! With their kids! ""Come on, junior, let's go watch the giant lizards eat the stupid people! It'll be a laugh!"" What kind of messed-up family outing is that? ""Look, sweetie, there's a velociraptor disemboweling that poor schmuck, the security guard! Isn't that hilarious?""

And there's always the same cast of characters, isn't there? The dino expert who swears, ""Never again! I'm done!"" and five minutes later, he's on the chopper heading back to Monster Island. Are you an idiot, or is the paycheck that good? Then there's the couple on the brink of divorce who figures, ""Hey, a vacation surrounded by flesh-eating dinosaurs? Perfect couples therapy!"" And you can't forget the kids! The goddamn kids! Instead of running like hell, where do they hide? INSIDE THE RAPTOR PEN! What are you, brain-dead? ""Oh, look, a dark, confined space where nothing can find us... except for the ten-foot-tall killing machine with razor claws that LIVES HERE!""

And the best part is, every single time, they tell us: ""No, no, this time it's different! We've learned from our mistakes! It's 100% safe now!"" Safe? The only thing that's 100% safe is that a bunch of you are gonna end up as dino-chow! The only thing you can be sure of is that the catering on that island must be absolute garbage, because those dinosaurs always seem to prefer the taste of a fresh, out-of-shape American tourist. ""Mmm, this one tastes like cheeseburgers and entitlement!""

And the military! Don't even get me started on the military geniuses who think weaponizing raptors is a good idea. Are you serious? Those things would eat their own platoon before you could salute! ""We'll train them! Give them commands!"" What are they, goddamn poodles? These things see a soldier and think ""Happy Meal with a helmet!""

So yeah, Jurassic Park. It's a goddamn festival of human stupidity, served up with extra-large teeth. A monument to the arrogance of ""We can do anything, and screw the consequences!"" And we just sit there, watching, secretly hoping that this time the T-Rex will eat the right person – maybe the corporate stooge who greenlit the park in the first place. But you know who always gets it in the end? The lawyer on the toilet. That's about the only poetic justice in this whole damn franchise of idiots who keep building theme parks with animals that see us as a light snack. Give me a goddamn break!",excited,Funny

Meanwhile, I was slumped on the couch, emotionally buffering, and it was out there living: cleaning, exploring, maybe even nurturing a complicated relationship with the mop in the corner.

Honestly, I started to envy it. It has purpose. It has direction. It has a backup battery. I don’t even have decent toothpaste.

I think it’s time I make it a Tinder profile. Who knows, maybe it’ll find love before I do. Or at least have a romantic dinner with the kitchen blender.

Because in order for a young koala to properly digest their otherwise toxic staple meal of eucalyptus leaves, they first need a digestive system packed with special gut bacteria that only mature koalas have - so that's when Mama steps in. As a young koala reaches about 6 months of age they nuzzle near their mother's cloaca, where she instinctively produces a specialized poo called ""pap"".

"Frightening My Daughter I’ve been binging the Stephen King audiobook Holly Gibney series for a couple weeks while wearing my Beats noise cancelling headphones. Sailing away into a creepy fantasy world that only Stephen King can create imo. 4 hour drive to Nebraska for my sons college football spring game, Stephen King. 2 hours that night in a sketchy Motel in Lincoln (Thanks to Expedia), Stephen King. 2 hours the following morning. 4hr hour drive home. In the Garage “Man Cave” (I’ve named the “Garage Lodge”) that night. Pretty much any free moment I have, Stephen King. Because Im not a very jumpy type person, my wife finds it funny to sneak up behind me while wearing my noise cancelling headphones, absolutely engrossed and scare me. Now my 11yr old daughter thinks it’s funny too and has joined Her Mother in startling me while listening. So when I was cleaning up the “Garage Lodge” and heard the scraping sound of dragging 1 of 2 trash cans up the drive after trash day to put back along the side of the house, I decided to get some retribution. I grabbed a “Scary Movie” type hood/mask from the garage, creeped to the exact corner of the house she should arrive at, and waited silently. When the perfect moment was upon us I leapt out and made a frightening sound only to see the little neighbor girl doing an act of kindness by dragging our trash cans back for us. She stood there absolutely frozen and eyes wide as I quickly removed the hood and my grimacing face and said, “Omg, honey!! I’m sorry. I thought you were my daughter and I was trying to scare HER!”
…. “Umm it worked.” 
Right then, my daughter came walking around the corner carrying her backpack with a big grin on her face. “Let me guess, my Dad thought you were me and tried to scare me and got you instead. Good try Dad!” And they started walking away while she telling her how they’ve been scaring me and looked back at me shaking her head with a grin and said, “You failed!” 😂",excited,Funny

5:30pm Mother drives Aunt to the park where Son and Father are playing soccer.

5:40pm  Aunt stays at the park with our Honda and Son. Father and Mother leave in a Ford. 

6pm Soccer ends. Aunt either stays at the park to play with Son or goes home for a little bit before heading out to get Daughter.

6:25 Aunt leaves with Son to get Daughter from the dance studio.

6:45 Daughter's class ends. Aunt takes both kids home.

7pm Feed the kids if they are hungry.

8:30pm Do bedtime routine with the kids.

9:30pm Parents will come home.

Ok, great. Clear, concise, no issues, I know exactly what the schedule is.

Here's the AI summary. Here's what was on top of that email:

You babysit Aunt's children after their soccer practice at the park, with Aunt staying at the park until 6:25 pm to pick up Son, who she then takes home to join Daughter for her class, and you have dinner and tuck the kids in for bed.

# Note

* Perform bedtime routine on kids.
* Arrange for Mother to babysit Aunt.
* Aunt and Son to play at the Park to meet Son and Father playing soccer.
* Decide on Aunt's movement and sleep schedule upon soccer's end.
* Aunt and Son are left at the park to play and may run away.
* Prepare dinner for the kids.
* Pick up Daughter from her class.
* Ensure kids are asleep by parents home.
* Transport Aunt from the recipient's house to the park to meet Son and Father playing soccer.

This unhinged ""summary"" is longer than the actual schedule! Apparently, the kids are mine, my sister is babysitting me, and her son may run away! Also, my movement and sleep schedule need to be decided on before Son finishes soccer. And the whole thing STARTS with the bedtime routine.

I started reading it and immediately called my sister to ask her if she has lost her mind, before realizing this was an AI summary. So the good news is that my sister does not need to be committed, but whoever implemented this at Yahoo should be.",excited,Funny

TWCW: my (soon to be 90) Gma has Lewy Body Dementia and is going to pass away soon. It gets real heavy and emotional. There’s also legit Nazis, abuse, threats of violence, trauma, inpatient psychiatric units, cancer, and bears; oh my! (Disclaimer: there are no bears in this story) 

TL/DR (at the bottom) 

My Gma and I have always been tight. She likes that I call her Gma. I’m her Pretty Lady. I always have been. Growing up, and well into my teens, we wrote letters back and forth. Letters about our shared interests. Secret crushes. Aspirations. My dream of being Hayley Williams from Paramore’s personal ASL Interpreter. How my interpreting program at Northeastern was going. And if we didn’t write, we talked on the phone. And when she couldn’t see anymore, we talked more. 

My Gma is a lonely soul. I mean that in the way that she’s always wanted to be left alone. She’s strong as shit. She’s an Austrian Immigrant who fled from her home to the US when she was in her teens. She had her house bombed. She had Nazis line her up with others and threatened by a death squad. This woman had the “opportunity” to shake hands with Hitler himself and WALKED AWAY. She became a DEA agent. She has seen her abusive but well loved husband die of alcoholism. She has seen her last born suffer through brain cancer and die two weeks before he could see his first son born. She has seen some sh*t. We both have in different ways. 

She found solace in music and so did I. Her house always smelled like fresh apple strudels and just cooked schnitzel. Classical music drifted from her record player. I was educated in what the Vienesse waltz was and how to move my body gracefully like the dancers in Vienna Philharmonic I watched every year on New Year’s morning when everything felt new and possible. She taught me to foxtrot, too. 

She was abusive, too. To her children. In their relationships. She became nasty and spiteful at any slight you might not even have meant. All at once when I was around 12 and my life was a wirlwind (baby brother, hormones, moving across the country from Atlanta to New Jersey ), we stopped seeing her on Thanksgiving. Or Christmas. We never watched the Philharmonic with her again. 

We still wrote. That nasty woman I had seen make make the strongest, most bad ass, Colombian immigrant woman I know, my mother, cry again and again never showed me her face. I’ve always been her pretty lady. I always will be. 

Two years ago, she started to forget. I graduated from Northeasten in 2018 for ASL Interpreting by the skin of my teeth but not for a lack of trying. I worked part time at Starbucks to make ends meet, and also on campus through Work Study. My family is not wealthy and I needed to make my way through college somehow. My Aunt, my grandma, my Aunt S, and my family helped where they could. In my last year, I worked, I took full time classes, I volunteered, and I interned at Work Community Independence. I got a promotion to Shift Leader at Starbucks. When I graduated, I had a month of exuberance.I did it, somehow I did it. I even met the literal CEO of Starbucks and had the balls to write him a letter! And then I broke. Literally. I had a manic psychotic break and was diagnosed with Bipolar 1. 

I ended up in an inpatient psychiatric hospital for a week. It was actually great! I learned awesome things. The big downside? The woman I accidentally asked if she was pregnant my first day because I was out of my mind liked my dress a lot. She liked it so much, she came up close one day and said, “I like your dress. I like it so much I could rip it off of your cold dead body, if you know what I mean.” She then flashed my her palm; a pair of sharp scissors she stole from craft class. 

How I got out of that one without screaming, I don’t know. How I got out of it unharmed, I don’t know. But I did. I laughed like it was a funny joke. I played along. We were going to sit and collage some things but I “forgot some supplies from my room.” I passed a Spanish speaking janitor and whispered quietly, “Ella tiene tijeras.” She has scissors. I walked to my room around a corner, down a hallway, and got the attention of a nurse. She has scissors and threatened to kill me with them. 

The security guard caught her using them to cut up a magazine. I was safe. She didn’t suspect me. Two days later, the psychatric hospital went into shut down. I heard someone say there was blood. A lot of blood. And then that same woman was carted away on a stretcher passed me with a white hospital sheet covering her from the shoulders down. To this day I don’t know if she’s ok or not. I hope she is. Being out of your mind is scary, and I know she was. We both were. All of us there were. 

When I talked to GMa, she was supportive. I was her pretty lady. I was strong. Also, how was college going? Was I enjoying my classes? Which one was my favorite. It took one month of returning to work for me to have another episode again in September. This time, my mom took me home to New Jersey. And to a hospital in New Jersey. Where I cried every night and asked to speak with my mom. Where every night I was told no so I cried more because I didn’t understand where I was. 

So they took me, forcibly, kicking and screaming into isolation. A cold dark room with a cold dark mattress on the floor. They held me down, they injected me with sedatives. They got me so f*cked up on Lithium that I stopped crying. I stopped doing anything. I stopped FEELING anything. After a week, my mom threatened to get the press involved if they wouldn’t release me, so they did. They released me to a break up with my partner of six and a half years because he needed “time to figure himself out” in October. He didn’t have time for me. 

I went on medical leave for half a year. I grieved. I cut my hair. I stayed in my parents home. The medications made me gain 40 pounds in 3 months. There were stretch marks where there never used to be. I hated what I saw when I looked in the mirror. But Gma was always there for me. Over the years of letter writing, she sent me notebooks. She know I aspired to be a writer one day so they were endless and I LOVED THEM. 

I loved one more than the others so naturally I never wrote in it save a few pages. It came with a card. It came with a quote on the cover. It came with a letter and a quote posted in her lovely handwriting. “Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass. It is about learning to dance in the rain.” 

She started to get bad and quickly. My parents moved her in with them. At first, it was ok. My mom reformed their relationship. She’s worked in group homes before with individuals with disabilities. She’s also just the most caring being that there is and couldn’t stand to see Hermine suffer. But then the abuse began. It got physical. There was screaming. COVID hit. They isolated, with a woman slowly losing her mind. 

When I visited them with my amazing partner now after getting negative COVID tests, I was still her Pretty Lady. She was happy I found someone who has changed my life in all the right ways. She asked about my classes. She told me how much she loved me. I taught her how to call me on her Alexa so we could talk again. She asked Matthew if he knew what his name meant. “It means ‘gift from God’ and you are a gift from God,” she said, “take care of each other. Love each other. Be my Pretty Lady’s ‘Knight In Shining Armor.’ She deserves it.” We cried. We hugged. We said we’d see each other soon. 

Understand something about my Gma. She is very smart. She also has never trusted doctors after Germany invaded her homeland. When she goes to a doctor, she knows what to say to get them to let her go. She tricked three into believing she didn’t have dementia. She remembered the three words at the beginning of their conversation three times. My parents couldn’t get guardianship over her. 

It took my Aunt, Cousin and their wife bringing her to Maryland, setting up baby monitors, watching her every second of every day, and eventually having to put her in an inpatient unit to get her the care she needs. They were able to get guardianship over her when she was judged unable to care for herself. That’s where she is now. I’m terrified of calling her. I know she wants her alone time and independence back. She wants to be left alone to die. What could I say to her? but today my hypomanic brain came up with some ideas.

I love signing. I love singing. I love both so much I translate songs into ASL. I obsess over songs. I play them over and over and over until I can sing the song to a recorder, hear myself, and not cringe. I made my GMa a playlist of songs I love. They have such meaning to me and to us. I hope she will find comfort in listening to it. She doesn’t have a lot of time left. Her birthday is December 12th.

For her birthday, I’m going to learn to play the guitar and play and sing to her an acoustic set of the playlist. I’m going to make it into a CD. So for the days she feels so lonely and hopeless that she wants to harm herself or others, she can listen and remember her Pretty Lady. She can find comfort in me like I’ve found comfort in her. 

You can help me do this, too. It her 90TH BIRTHDAY on December 12. Please write to Hermine Spears. Tell her all of your secrets. Tell her your biggest dreams. Your biggest fears. I will read them to her. I’ll read and read and read until she’s not here to hear me anymore. And even still, when she passes, I will read them on my days of mourning. I know they’re coming and fast. 

We can all use some positive vibes right now. Times are tough. Do me this favor. Your good deed of the day is as easy as picking up a card, making one of you want, writing a short Happy Birthday note. Writing a long letter if you feel like it. Buying a stamp. Helping the Post Office. I haven’t set up a P.O. Box yet, but when I do, I’ll make another post. I’ve already made the set list. It’s linked below. If you wanna hear me sing, I’ll post some vids in the comments. 

Also, please leave me some dope memes in the comments. I’m hypo manic AF right now and cannot sleep. Thanks for reading this incredibly long post and thanks in advanced for the letters. I know she will love them. 

TL/DR: my GMa has very little time left and has dementia. Her mind is going. I want to do something special for her birthday so I’m going to send her a playlist of songs I like and for her birthday, I’m going to learn to play the guitar and get voice lessons to safety socially distance sing for her in real life, hopefully she’ll make it that long. Please write her a letter for her birthday. I will give read her as many as I can until she’s not here to hear them, and even when she’s gone. Also, holy sh*t, please vote.

"Fight the fear before the fall because your immune system responds to emotions. I normally never step out of the house. But today I had to go to my son's house which is an hour's drive from where I live. This is What I saw on the way - every 10 -15 meters there were huge 12 feet by 12 feet and 15 feet by 15 feet hoardings or banners or posters about Corona virus. Although the messages were educative, important and much needed, I got the distinct feeling that the virus was gaining the upper hand by its sheer overpowering presence in the media. It's capturing our focus and attention almost every where and every waking moment. And although not directly, but so much focus and attention is giving the virus more and more energy, a stronger foothold and this is spreading fear very sublimely. Fear is know to mess with the parasympathetic system and our immunity. Fear is powerful as its easier to adopt than hope and love. Fear is the absence of  love. Fear leads to darkness. What is darkness but the absence of light. This is not to say that the adviced precautions, medication and steps that need to be taken to keep you safe and healthy shouldn't be taken, but it is also now time for each and every one of us to add additional powers of recovery, recuperation and resistance to this invasion. It is time for everyone of us to  become a light worker, a light bearer, a beacon of light. Because light is the only solution to darkness.

"Global Survey Identifies What Makes Humans Flourish What does it mean to live a good life? For centuries, philosophers, scientists and people of different cultures have tried to answer this question.

"Beyond the Boogeyman: Why Need for Happiness Might Be Our Biology Talking. Camus's haunting portrayal of a long, meaningless, and isolating existence in ""The Stranger"" often feels as relevant to us as it was to him. And yet, the modern ""happiness industry,"" including new age psychology seems to be obsessed with finding external culprits – be it a recent pandemic, social media, digital age  – All are busy searching for some ""boogeyman"" stealing our joy (especially here in North America).

But what if the problem lies deeper, within our very biology? Nature didn't design us for happiness or even any meaning. It assigns us only the purpose - Multiply and conquer.

Hence, that youthful euphoria? A potent hormonal cocktail pushing us towards that goal. After 35, the recipe changes, and life can take on a starker Hobbesian edge.

What if, instead of chasing some external fix, maybe we need to flip the script.

Life doesn't owe us happiness (heck, it does not even know we exist); perhaps we owe life. Biologically, early life is about connection and reproduction. Later, it shifts to independent creation and provision.

Loneliness/Purposelessness isn't a modern plague; it's a timeless human experience rooted in our biological drives and the subsequent search for purpose.

The question still remains – How to Find Happiness?

What helped me a lot in navigating this was the realization that to be happy, I must commit fully to becoming the best version of myself (health, job, status, etc.). It's like only the 'best specimens' are truly pushing life forward in this wild ride of evolution.

Consider exploring behaviourism and biology to understand our ""almost"" robotic Nature driven by evolution (B.F. Skinner, etc.). And for navigating the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe, existentialist philosophy (Kierkegaard, Sartre, Nietzsche) is invaluable. I also recommend Schopenhauer for his unique perspective.

What also significantly aided my self-realization was diving into Jungian psychology. For those interested in self-discovery, should I suggest starting with MBTI or Big Five tests? Lots of fun and potentially insightful!

"2000 was the last great year If there was ever a year I could go back to in a time machine, it would be the year 2000. Simply because it seemed like it was the last year there was a sense of innocence in American society. It all ended a year later on 9/11. Which then later led to the war on terrorism. Leading to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. And then to make matters worse the 2008 financial crisis hapend as well as growing income inequality. As well as extreme polarization in our politics. Leading to our country getting more and more divided.
The year 2000 seemed to be the last year things felt normal. I was a little kid at the time but I remember kids would play at the park. Go to each other’s houses and watch movies. Me and my freinds would go skating or ride our bikes around the neighborhood. Computers were a new thing. The internet was not even 10 years old yet. Smart phones and social media so people can still get out and have fun and enjoy their lives. Seemed like if you were a young person in your 20s dating was much easier. You could just go to a bar and hook up with someone, And get their number. People don’t even do that anymore because of dating apps. And it seemed like we were more united as a country. 

The division wasn’t as bad then. There was some division, especially with the election of that year between Al Gore and George Bush. However people weren’t as hooked on politics 24,7 Being a democrat or republican. It was like either being a Yankees fan or a Red Sox fan. People may be disagreed about politics, but they would still come over for dinner go out and grab a beer with them or watch a football game together. And at the end of the day we seemed to see each other as fellow Americans. Or more importantly fellow human beings. And despite political differences it wasn’t like a way of life like it is now. The things people cared the most about was there family, there children and there future, there friend’s and there work.
As well as trying to do well for there community. 

Last but not least the economy was amazing in the year 2000. Wages were still rising, it seemed to be the last year the middle class had a boom. With the continued prosperity from the 1990s. New homes and new cars were much cheaper. And yes, even though a lot of jobs in the 80s and 90s did go overseas there was still a lot of manufacturing in the United States at the time and maybe wasn’t as great as it was in the 60s and 70s. But you could still buy a decent amount of high-quality products still made in America that were new at the time. And we had a balanced budget and a budget surplus.",excited,Happiness
"Reddit is a cool tool. What do you all think of it? So i began exploring Reddit a few months to gain insight into the people in the world around me. People who I likely would never interact with in person due to various reasons. It has been interesting and sometimes fun. But overall, as with much of my experiences with others in personal life, does not inform me of anything more than I was already aware of. The synthesis of my experience is, AI driven platforms struggle to identify the full depth and dynamic of individuals who utilize their technology, because they lack the human nature to characterize nuances which although subtle, instantly redesign the algorithm by their very existence. When this context is overlooked during data processing, the information outputted can never be accurate. This is all just a more complicated way of saying, real life human interactions are vital. And AI cannot replace it. I gave AI a chance and to the extent I expected it could, it successfully accomplished what the programmers and developers programmed it to do. However, by approaching humans from an analytical scientific approach, this overlooks the humanity of them. I believe AIs place in human life has run its course and is at the peak of its value to humans. Any further investment in AI, would begin a divestment away from humans. This would deepen the codependency humans have upon AI and permanently decrease the interdependency humans have thrived with for millennia. The human spirit cannot be replaced with data sets.

"The Secret to Happiness Now there's a clickbait title if I've ever made one. Seriously though. Hey, kid. You wanna try some existential secrets? To provide some context to some generalized statements I'm about to make, I work as a consultant and clinical hypnotherapist; the thing I hear the most in my work is some form of 'I'm not happy' or 'All I want is to be happy' and the usually deafening silence that follows my answer, every time:

*So? Do it.*

Let me ask you a question. What is happiness? There's something we never really ask. Is it an emotion? No, not really. It has emotions associated with it, but it's far from an emotion. Is it a circumstance? No, nowhere near and I'll demonstrate how later. So what is it, then? What is that golden question: what is happiness?

It's a choice. It's a mindset. A chosen perception. I have worked with wealthy executives who had everything one could want and seen the most unhappy people; on the flipside, I have volunteered with people fleeing war without a penny to pay me and found in them individuals of pure joy. Happiness isn't in where you or or feel you should be. Not in a dollar amount or any other dragon we chase.

Happiness is a choice we have to make in each moment and sometimes that choice is hard. It's not delusional passivity, but rather a gratitude for existence and a willingness to see clearly those things in your life that make it worthwhile. When we can see those things, we can choose to be happy. I spent decades choosing to be unhappy. Angry. I chose differently, as an experiment of all things.

I end this with a simple question: what's your reason to be happy? What brings you joy in this world, even if for a moment. All of life is just a series of moments, after all. What are your good ones?",excited,Happiness

Basically the premise was that happiness is mostly physical.  And the guy says that he went from being depressed to happy 24-7 by some physical changes, which sounded hard to believe.

But i do feel like my happiest years were back before I had some health issues that have been bothering me in recent years.  

It just feels harder to feel truly happy these days.

"The problem with chasing happiness. Following a pretty large depressive episode, I spent this past summer relentlessly chasing happiness. I made lists of things that were supposed to bring me happiness and did them again and again, but happiness is an abstract concept that can’t be manufactured, happiness just comes and goes as it pleases. When you’re chasing happiness, you constantly measure your happiness (which is like your credit score, when you check it, it goes down) (unless you have credit karma! Which let’s you check your credit score for free!). If something doesn’t make you as happy as you expected, it’ll discourage you and lower happiness levels even more. When you are chasing actual goals, you instead get positive reinforcement each time you take a step forward. I found that the only times I found happiness were when I did something meaningful or difficult and made myself proud.

"Reason for Happiness or Unhappiness - Unearthed So, happiness is a topic which we talk about daily, and strive for it.

But what exactly is happiness. Let me tell you an obvious but often overlooked thing.

Happiness is just the difference between EXPECTATIONS and REALITY.

Pick up any area of your life where you're unhappy and this equation would fit.

Example : I'm unhappy I'm my corporate life.
Reason : I EXPECTED I'll get paid XYZ which I'm not getting paid, or I EXPECTED I'll not have this much work pressure and I'm having it.

Same for a relationship. I EXPECTED her to behave a certain way, which she didn't.

So what's the solution ? How can you EVER be happy ?

1. If the expectations are real / achievable :
Strive towards it, make efforts. Once you START making efforts, your unhappiness will vanish because you know your reality is getting closer to expectations - by working on it.

2. If your expectations are unreal:
Get a reality check. Reduce your expectations. Easier said than done, but embrace acceptance. Accept that this is the something which I won't get, and you'll be at peace and comfort in the long term (after probably initial discomfort).

"Is emotional training a real thing? Hey there, what I mean by ""emotional training"" is to react emotionally in a different way by just consciously trying to, and doing this consistently until your brain gets used to it. This would be extremely useful for decreasing the intensity of negative emotions in reaction to life's negative events, and then increasing your overall happiness. 

For example, an individual who is dealing with a any negative situation, like a break up or something, could try to consciously force themselves to feel less negative about it, obviously in a gradual and coherent manner (that is, without simply trying to jump from negative to positive in one second). And as life goes on, each time this individual would become more emotionally resilient. ",excited,Happiness
"The ultimate tool to overcome suffering and be happy? Hey there, I think I found a technique extremely powerful and simple which can lower emotional suffering (bc I think that being capable of regulating negative emotions is far more important than generating positive emotions to become a happy individual). I call it ""emotional recalibration"" for dramatic and mnemonic purposes. 

Emotional recalibration means to empty your mind for a few seconds/minutes and actively try to go from a negative intense emotion to a neutral state (not cheerful), and doing that as gradually as possible. That's basically the exercise. You can do it while breathing deeply and as many times as needed.

The idea is not to eliminate your negative feelings, bc you're allowed to feel bad, but not too much to the point it ruins your happiness. It's like gradually convincing your brain that it's ok to not feel this bad even if the bad situation that's disturbing you is still there. *Gradually* is the key term, and also *neutral state* since it's obviously useless to try to become cheerful all of a sudden. Also not needed to change your thoughts about anything or forcing yourself to be optimistic about inherently negative things (that strategy is useless as well). 

I've personally been applying this technique and... It's just too powerful if you do it seriously.

"Figure out who you are I just had this conversation with a coworker who is consistently unhappy at work and is often the recipient of attention from management because of various perceived shortcomings.  

A little background.  I am almost 50, and he is in his very early 30s.  I have learned things throughout my life both professionally and privately that have led me to say the things I said to him, and will say to you.  

I once defined myself as who I was professionally.  If I met someone, I always weaved into the conversation (usually quite early) that I was a (insert job title here).  I identified my worth based on how I performed at work, how my upward mobility looked, what my title was, how much responsibility I had, who reported to me etc.....  Even typing that now sounds gross honestly.  Even though I would have never admitted that I identified myself in such a manner, looking back, I know factually that I did.  

In my early 40s I was at the pinnacle of my career and thought the possibilities were endless.  I was on the fast track to the top, and I knew it.  Everyone knew it.  I fed off of this and  knew that the workplace I was in would collapse if I left.  Again,  I feel gross even typing that.  Things changed and I left earlier than expected.  I made a complete career change along with a move across several states.  I expected the old workplace to struggle, but watched as my former position was filled within a month or so, and things went on business as usual.  I then started to realize that I was living a lie by thinking that I was what was holding the place together.  Sound gross?  Think that isn't you?  If it isn't and you know it, then great.  Deep down though, there are many of us who feel this to a degree in our profession.  

I refocused my life.  I started to focus on who I REALLY wanted to be.  for  me it was being a dad, a hockey parent, a hockey goalie, a guy who likes to collect bourbon, a guy who enjoys being home with my wife and kids etc.....  That is who I am.  Not who I am as a professional.  When you leave your current role, you will be replaced.  At home however, you are NOT replaceable.  

Once I started to embrace this a few years ago, I started sleeping better, feeling better, treating people better, enjoying life more fully.  

I don't have all the answers.  But this is one that I figured out the hard way, and would love to help you figure it out too!    ",excited,Happiness

"I’ve never had a girlfriend and I’m 26M. I’m I just not made to date? I’m 26M and I’m gonna be 27M in a few weeks. And I have never had a girlfriend, I’m still a virgin. I have only gone out on dates with 4 woman in my life. The closest thing I have ever had to a girlfriend was back in high school. I was 17M and she was 17F We dated for 3 months but never go very serious. We were more just friends. Now today I look at it and I question am I just not made to date. Like literally is it just something that is just not within my ability to make happened. Because I I’ve tried everything from dating apps, to trying to make friends with girls. Even trying to reach out to woman I was friends with in my childhood. And I get getting the same rejection. And It makes me literally feel humiliated and embarrassed as well as a fell totally worthless like I matter to nobody. It just hurts inside that I feel inferior to everyone else. I never asked for this I never desired it. I ask myself all the time “how and why”. Some days literally hate my self because I feel like I’m the type who was never made to find love or be around woman. Why is it that the littlest thing I could do, turn a woman off. It make no sense it shouldn’t be like being interviewed by police were everything you say goes in record. Seriously the littlest thing I couldn’t do like get nervous when talking to a girl. Or stumble on a word or talk to long. Any of those things will make them go from interested to not in less than 2 to 5 seconds. It pisses me of and it makes no sense. Why is it so hard for them to commit and keep there word. Even if I just ask them to do something as friends something casual. Like go on a hike or see a movie. Which is why I am scared am I just gonna have to face the grim reality, that there’s nobody out there for me and I just need to forfeit my dreams of ever getting married and having a family. It makes me incredibly sad to think about it but I’m afraid that I’m doomed with ever being able to find a girl to date or go out with.

My stepdad is already a dad of two children so when he met my mom a mother of 3 it was hard for all of us to get used to him.

Both him, my mom, and my two step siblings all traveled to come see my school musical because they knew how much I wanted then to see it and as I was introducing them to my friends and directors I called him my dad.

"JOURNALING makes me HAPPY :) Hi, I am journaling for a while now and I can see a strong effect on my happiness and well-being. There is tons of research on this but just to mention a few scientifically proven effects:

* journaling reduces stress and improves immune system
* releases negative emotions

Last year, I started reading a lot of papers and books about happiness and well-being and I believe that journaling and self-reflection are among the GREATEST tools to live a happy and fulfilled live. Bases on this excitement, I started a project with a friend called **layers**. It is a digital journal that helps you reflect on what matters for your happiness (e.g. on your relationships or your emotions), that gives you advice and where you can learn more about the underlying science of happiness.

We are looking for people that want to test the app and give feedback (and potentially co-develop new ideas with us). Let me know if you have any advice or thoughts → you can test it here for free: [layersjournal.app](https://layersjournal.app).",excited,Happiness
"Now I'm starting to pursue external goals I was always interested in internal goals, like self-improvement, being authentic, and practicing mindfulness etc. For the longest time I never pursued external goals, like being wealthy, getting materialistic things, fame, and improving my looks because those are things I can't control. I'm 27 years old, and I feel content with my choices.

But now that I ensued my internal goals and I'm pretty happy currently, there's a part of me that craves for more. A strong desire to make millions, be famous, and get the body I always wanted is burning inside me. And now feel more motivated now that I have something external to chase. I have so much energy; it's like I tapped into some dark power or something. It's odd how this never happened for my internal goals. 

I do have a plan to achieve these goals, and they are practical for me. I want to let you know that it does put a big smile on my face just thinking that I will get there someday",excited,Happiness

According to the world happiness report, the United States and Canada had the strongest decline in happiness of all western countries, of about 10% and being on place 120 of 134 countries. Especially amongst the young, happiness levels are dropping significantly, most likely due to climate change, social inequities, and political polarization which can all be amplified on social media (according to John Helliwell, a Professor Emeritus at University of British Columbia).

"My life for the last 3 years has been a miserable period for me I have almost no friends and I am literally almost sad everyday Hollo I am a 26m gonna be 27m in just a few months. And I feel like my life for the last 3 years has been a complete joke. The reason why is because the vast majority of Al my freinds that I was close with Who just a few years ago we were having an amazing time. My life felt like it was good and going in a positive direction. Me and my buddies hade a great time together we would go to parties and clubs. And I felt like I belonged to something and that I mattered to somebody. But now I have like only 2 freinds I’m close with one from work the other from from school. But it’s not the same every time we go out we just do simple things we don’t go out parting or to clubs. I have 2 friends from high school that I still talk to but I only see them once a year. This is not what I want for myself. I wanna be able to expand my territory and have way more friends than I do it the moment. But Even when I meet people and that have the same interests as me They still bail on me when I try to do stuff with them. I frankly feel like my life is just a black whole and it’s hasn’t gotten better. I litterly feel sad everyday, there are days we’re I am happy and it last for a few days and I feel good about myself but it only last for a while and the self loathing kicks in just days after. And I can’t just and the regret the feeling of being locked out of all the opportunities to have friends and have fun take over. I don’t cry about it because I feel that I need to be strong and not let it get to me sometimes il cry but it’s pretty rare. I don’t wanna turn 30 and look back at my 20s as a time off disappointment. I wanna remember my 20s as a time of joy and happiness and pride. I don’t wanna remember it as a lonely time. I’m only 26m but I feel like I’m 76m and I feel like an old man. I feel old and it’s not a feeling that I should have at my age this is supposed to be a time to be joyful and happy. Because of this I have delt with over the years I feel like I have lost a sense of meaning in my life, because the self loathing kicks in and takes over. I feel like I’ve missed the opportunity to do things like travel places being apart of my friends weddings. I cannot keep feeling this way.

"What do you all think about this longest study on happiness?  https://youtu.be/8KkKuTCFvzI?si=G3awKhgTt_E1DV9H

When I first watched it, I felt it totally made sense. After all humans are social animals. 

Today it was the fifth time I watched it, my critical thinking started to kick in. 

I wonder if people are socially constrained to believe happiness is all about having good relationships with other people hence they spent more effort to maintain relationships? 

If people are brainwashed by the society to believe painting gives you happiness, they’d all spend a lot of time on painting then report a high level of happiness because their brains have already associated achievement in painting with happiness? 

Just like society usually define a man’s success as having a wife and kids never divorce, I heard my parents in law (well, ex parents in law soon haha) talked proudly how they were still together but all old people they know had divorced n ended up being alone. 

I heard their comment and I thought what was wrong of being alone? How do you know they aren’t happily alone? 🤔 

Another thought I have is that I find this scientific study contradicts some philosophical ideas on happiness. 

True happiness is within. It’s self content. It shouldn’t be replied upon how well you get along with others. If relationship is the biggest factor, wouldn’t that mean your happiness is affected by factors you can’t even control (you can’t control others n what they do in a relationship with you). That’s definitely against stoicism.

"Everyday habits that are making you hate yourself  

we all have this negative voice in our heads whose only job is to remind us of our mistakes and the things we’re not good at.

But what if I told you that this voice is not you?

This voice is basically the result of habits that you’ve picked up over time without even realizing it - habits that are making this inner critic louder and louder.

One of those subtle habits is **Carrying a False Persona**. Maybe you are someone who acts differently at work or online. Maybe you act funnier or more adventurous because someone once told you, ‘You’re funny’ or they would love to hang out with you. Or you might be having a tough time but don’t want to worry your friends and family, so you pretend that everything is fine. People seem to like this act, so you keep doing it, even if it’s not really you. But what most of us don’t realize is that if you’re constantly pretending to be someone you’re not, you start to dislike the false persona you present to the world and by extension, yourself for creating it.

Another habit that makes us hate ourselves is **not letting ourselves be happy**. Imagine you are someone who has always been told that you’re not good enough, like a child who constantly hears that they should be more like their sibling. You hear it so much that you start to believe it. And you think that no matter what you do, it’s never good enough. Now you think that wanting to be happy is selfish. So you listen to that little voice in your head that tells you not to get your hopes up. It reminds you of all the times things went wrong when you let yourself feel happy. But you might not realize that when feelings of regret and self-blame grow to be unbearable, it can lead to self-hatred and keeps you from re-engaging with life.

Similar to this there are more habits like **failing to accept compliments**, **being insecure all the time**, **keeping gratification over responsibilities** and more. So before these habits take a toll on our self-esteem, it is important to address them.

I recently came across some interesting research studies and articles on this topic and decided to create an [animated video](https://youtu.be/P8mIitxNWx0?si=ym6WHIWoSy10saOJ) to illustrate the topic.

If you prefer reading, I have included important reference links below.

I hope you find this informative. I’d love to hear your thoughts on it!

Cheers!

"What is the reason behind people preferring to feel empty inside instead of being happy?  

There are different types of people. One who are trying to be cheerful, happy, laughing. Their life is the life of achievement, success, pleasure. This is ephemeral. This is momentary. But there are some people who prefer to move from a state of pleasure to a state of peace. They like this emptiness because this emptiness is peace. It's the very foundation of happiness. They live with contentment and fulfillment. They experience eternal bliss, that forever flows. Not pleasure that comes and goes and this is a choice. We can choose success and achievement, pleasure, wealth, name and fame. All we can choose contentment and fulfillment, peace and tranquility. There are some who go beyond achievement and even fulfillment. They reach enlightenment. Then there is no empty feeling. There is the feeling of Divine love, eternal bliss and everlasting peace.",excited,Happiness
"I dont have long to live due to pancreatic cancer. But here i have written the answer to depression and the discovery of happiness. please discuss. thank you.  

Why be happy and defeat depression with no afterlife?:

With no afterlife or “reason” for being here, we are left with life as it lies before us preceding the opportunity we get to choose to interpret its results. The possibility for any event to occur is best described by a system of mathmatics that is near-impossible for both the layman and the genius to comprehend. The metaphysical reasons for these mathmatics is a debate that, while philosophically enjoyable, is ultimately unawnserable. But the impossibility of the existence of an answer is why we should be content with our “reason” for existing in the first place.

The likelihood of you existing, your history and even the event of you reading this text are so improbable that the existence of it alone should be celebrated. It may be that there is no definitive answer to the “why” and comprehension of this concept will always be a struggle, as this introspective odyssey has plagued us for millennia. But the fact that it is even being questioned is a testament to human greatness. Our ability to quest for truth evidences the beautiful luck we have to be the ones on the very journey we find ourselves contending to begin with.

No matter how desperate life becomes, the fact that we can call it as such is so immeasurably preferable to nothingness that it exemplifies why true appreciation of the fact of existence is not only a reality, but is conducive and paramount to discovering an undefinable yet veraciously concluded unanimous happiness.

Because of our ability to reason, only we as humans on this earth have the opportunity to experience this kind of contentment. And while human societies around the globe waste this life and destroy the opportunities we are afforded, you as an individual still have the ability to be joyfully purposeful. Be free of the moral chains that our societies cast you in.

For you are real, so you are true. You are that truth we forever attempt to seek. You are what is beautiful in this temporal realm that is fortunate to be. You should do nothing but rejoice. You need not the metaphysical “realities” put forward by the potentially destructive socially created philosophies of religious entities to simply love the experience of our stunning pre-existence. They are inherently a misunderstanding of the beauty of being.

Because to survive is optional, but to live is to succeed regardless of what may come after death. If I provide anyone reading this with anything it would be this: Use the capacities you are given as a living being as best as you can, because the best luck you’ll ever ascertain is to live in the first place.

I hope I contribute happiness to all those I meet. Ultimately, the words I have written before you is the opus I hope to leave behind to describe why I believe all of us deserve and are able to achieve ultimate happiness.

Hate is therefore the enemy of this existential discovery, and for that love should forever be the ubiquitous retort.

P.S: I struggled with mental health disorders due to losing my boyfriend and suffering severe physical health disorders, rendering me part-disabled. I have plenty reason to recede into a emotionally destructive pit.

"Today, I'm content to have (finally) published a short-film I made about a topic that has affected my happiness: Overthinking Video Link:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsQ94D8FuA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsQ94D8FuA)

Happiness, I once thought, was the absence of worries. About a year ago though, I realized an overactive mind was the thief of my joy. In moments of introspection, I noticed that much of my discontent stemmed from incessant overanalysis.

I decided to capture this realization in a short film. The film idea randomly came to me one day, and I'm grateful to have finally finished. In it is both a portrayal of how my mind feels in these moments and a friend's insights on the topic that resonated deeply with me. His perspective on overthinking remains one I continue to revisit from time-to-time.

Creating this video wasn't just about documenting thoughts; it was a continuous process of internalizing, understanding, learning, and unlearning. For too long, I viewed the pursuit of happiness purely as an absence, a state defined by what I lacked. But now, I see it equally as a journey of subtraction—shedding the unnecessary thoughts that cloud judgment.

There will always be more that can be done in every situation, but I have learned that it is perfectly OK to decide when I have done ""enough"". That I can strive to do everything in my control, but recognize that my actions fall along an asymptote where completion, likely, never truly reaches ""100%"".

And when in doubt, to not think - just do.

It's my second (amateur) short film - I wanted to share it here in hopes that maybe at least one person will take something away from it. If you feel compelled, I'd love to hear your thoughts :)

Since I'm 15-16 I became a people pleaser/yesman. I always searched for the approval of other people and changed my opinions just to be liked by other people. I had no real personality.

"Which results in more happiness, indulgence, moderation, or surprises? I'm looking for some scientific answers to a hypothetical scenario relating to human behavior.

Imagine that you have an unlimited supply of cookies, and eating them brings you happiness. But unlike normal cookies, these cookies only cost $0.02 each and only contain 4 calories. You can eat many dozens of them every day without any direct negative consequences.

If your goal is to maximize the amount of happiness you derive from eating these cookies, would you be better off:

**A.** Stuffing yourself with lots of cookies multiple times every day

**B.** Limiting yourself to 1 cookie per day or 1 cookie per week

**C.** Asking your roommate or a computer to dispense cookies to you at random intervals

&#x200B;

With option A, you would get the most cookies but the experience could quickly loose its novelty and the thought of eating another cookie would likely become gradually less appealing. 

With option B, you have something to look forwards to and time to appreciate the cookies more. But over time it may start to feel routine and less appealing. You would be spreading the happiness out over a longer period of time, but would the grand total really be any higher than with option A?

With option C, every cookie is a pleasant surprise that you weren't expecting. However because you aren't anticipating the cookies you don't get to look forwards to their arrival. You will also never know when the next cookie will come, which could make you anxious.

The same scenario could be appleid to many things in life. I bet most of us here have faced decisions like this without even realizing it. Which option would lead to the maximum amount of happiness and why?",excited,Happiness
"Why do people talk so much?  Sometimes we wonder why people talk too much or have asked ourselves, Why do I talk too much”?

Maybe its your friend or a coworker who always dominates the conversation or interrupts you constantly, and it can be painful to have a conversation with someone like that.

According to psychology, a lot of people don’t even realize they are overly talking, because in most cases, they genuinely get excited to respond to what you’ve just said.

Another reason behind this behavior is childhood experience. a child who had to compete with siblings for parental attention may develop a habit of talking too much to get noticed 

On the other hand, Some people talk a lot because they want to control the conversation. Studies have shown that people who do this are seen as more powerful by others.

This trait is often seen in people who are narcissistic, who just want to show off their achievements to seek validation from others.

But narcissism is not the only reason why someone might talk too much, it can also be a symptom of mental health conditions such as ADHD and bipolar disorder

The Psychology Behind Excessive Talking

"How to Stop Caring What Others think of you In order to stop caring what others think of you, You need to understand the root cause of this behavior and **why we do it** 

According to psychology, Our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us. If we were criticized, neglected, or abused, we are more likely to have low self-esteem and be more sensitive to the judgments of others.

Interestingly, studies show that children as young as two years old are already aware that they’re being evaluated by others, and they will adjust their behavior to seek a positive response.

This need for social acceptance and fear of rejection is still present in adulthood because social media has become another common approach to seek approval. where many of us consider social media personas as an extension of your self worth, even though your value as a person hasn’t changed.

So we cant just delete this human nature out of our system so **what can you do about it?**

 The first step is to build a strong mindset by **Expecting and accepting that people will always have opinions of you,** the truth is There’s no use in trying to avoid any judgment because it’s simply impossible. And when you expect that people will always have opinions, you become more resilient to criticism.

Another thing to keep in mind is when you are in social situations, STOP TRYING TO READ Other’s MINDs, Those who care about others’ opinions often believe they’re being noticed more than they really are,  which is a psychological phenomenon knows as “**The spotlight effect**” 

But in reality we are all in a midst of our personal accomplishments and humiliating situations that most of us usually focus on what is happening to us as well as how other people see it. 

After reading research studies and articles I made an animated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7ofWl5DkI) to illustrate this topic, explaining  how our childhood experiences have a big impact on how much we care about what others think of us .

## Intro[ (00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=0s)

* [*Arthur Brooks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Brooks) *is a world-renowned social scientist,*[ *Harvard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University) *professor, and best-selling author who teaches people how to live happier lives.*
* *He has studied the science of happiness and found that most of what society tells us about happiness is wrong.*
* *Happiness is about 50% genetic, introverts tend to have more long-term happiness, and happiness is contagious.*
* *Happiness has been in decline since about 1990, one reason being that we need struggle and suffering to appreciate joy.*
* *Setting realistic goals that lead to happiness is more effective than pursuing unattainable ideals like weight loss or financial success.*
* *Subscribing to the channel helps scale production and improve content quality.*

## Are You a Professor of Happiness?[ (00:02:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=133s)

* *Arthur Brooks is a professor of leadership and happiness at Harvard University.*
* *He studies the science of happiness, a multi-dimensional field that draws from social psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics, and philosophy.*
* *He aims to help future leaders understand themselves as happiness teachers, enabling them to be happier, more successful, and bring more happiness to those they lead.*

## State of Happiness[ (00:02:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=158s)

* *Measuring happiness across countries is challenging due to methodological limitations.*
* *Happiness within countries and communities over time can be studied, and most*[ *OECD*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD) *countries, including the US and UK, have experienced a decline in happiness since around 1990.*

## Personal Roots of Interest in Happiness[ (00:03:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=200s)

* *Arthur Brooks is not naturally a happy person and attributes 50% of his happiness to genetics.*
* *He emphasizes that childhood experiences shape happiness, but individuals can rewrite their past by reflecting on their upbringing and making conscious choices to create a different future for themselves and their families.*

## Hope and Survival[ (00:07:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=448s)

* *Hope is critical for survival and well-being.*
* *Loss of hope leads to giving up, neglecting self-care, and engaging in harmful behaviors that compound physiological degradation.*
* *Hope empowers individuals to take control of their future, leading to a longer, better, and more successful life.*

## Follow the Science to Be Happy[ (00:10:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=621s)

* *Understanding the science of happiness, applying it to one's life, and sharing it with others reinforces learning and enhances happiness.*
* *Discussing and teaching happiness-related ideas imprints them in the brain and promotes personal growth and well-being.*
* *Research shows that a sense of agency, the belief in one's control over life and future, correlates with happiness, longevity, and overall success.*
* *Learned helplessness, resulting from a perceived lack of control, degrades quality of life, happiness, and even lifespan.*

## Personal Responsibility[ (00:13:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=785s)

* *8% of people drop off reading a book when it comes to the part about personal responsibility.*
* *The author's columns on happiness that discuss humility and listening get fewer readers than those that focus on more controversial topics.*
* *People often identify victimhood in others but not in themselves.*
* *True happiness comes from recognizing and leveraging the power we have over our circumstances, starting with managing our emotions and well-being.*
* *Happiness is not a feeling but rather the pursuit of enjoyment, satisfaction, and meaning.*

## Enjoyment, Satisfaction, and Meaning[ (00:18:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=1085s)

* *Enjoyment is not the same as pleasure.*
* *Pleasure is a limited phenomenon that signals survival and gene propagation.*
* *Pursuing pleasure-filled things compulsively can lead to addiction and unhappiness.*
* *To turn pleasure into enjoyment, add people and memory to the experience, moving it from the limbic system to the prefrontal cortex.*
* *Pornography and masturbation are not good for happiness because they truncate the reproductive experience at the level of pleasure.*

## Addiction and Temporary Rewards[ (00:20:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=1201s)

* *Pleasure-filled things can become addictive and make you less happy if done compulsively.*
* *To turn pleasure into enjoyment, add people and memory to the experience.*
* *Pornography captures the brain and doesn't lead to happier lives on average because it truncates the reproductive experience at the level of pleasure.*

## How to Turn Pleasure into Happiness[ (00:23:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=1390s)

* *Pleasure + people + memory = enjoyment = happiness.*
* *Satisfaction = the joy after struggle.*
* *Successful people are good at deferring gratification.*
* *The marshmallow experiment: 80% of kids couldn't wait for a second marshmallow, but the 20% who waited went on to do better in life.*
* *Homeostasis: the brain returns to its baseline physiologically and emotionally.*
* *The hedonic treadmill: the constant pursuit of more never leads to lasting satisfaction.*
* *Successful people need to manage their wants more than their haves.*

## Diets: How the Process Is More Important Than the End Goal[ (00:28:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=1712s)

* *Diets fail because people regain the weight they lost.*
* *The reward for dieting is the scale going down, but this is not lasting.*
* *The arrival fallacy: the belief that reaching a goal will bring lasting happiness.*
* *Better goals to set are faith, family, friendship, and work that serves others.*
* *Intermediate goals, such as weight loss, are okay but should not be the final goal.*
* *The right final goals are those that lead to deeper faith, better family relationships, deeper friendships, and more meaningful work.*

## What's a Good End Goal for Fitness?[ (00:34:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=2088s)

* *Aim for health and happiness, not just physical appearance.*
* *Consistency in exercise and healthy habits leads to greater happiness and well-being.*
* *Focus on long-term goals like overall health and happiness rather than short-term goals like a six-pack.*

## The Why of Your Life[ (00:38:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=2293s)

* *Meaning in life comes from coherence (things happen for a reason), purpose (direction and goals), and significance (feeling that one's existence matters).*
* *Ask yourself: ""Why am I alive?"" and ""What am I willing to die for today?"" to find meaning and purpose.*
* *The order of operations for finding meaning in work should be: serve others, have fun, lift people up, and have an adventure.*
* *Reflect on these questions and explore your answers to gain a deeper understanding of your purpose and meaning in life.*

## Finding Purpose and Link to Unhappiness[ (00:43:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=2628s)

* *The idea of ""finding your purpose"" is often presented as a simple task, but it can be misleading.*
* *The phrase ""find your purpose"" implies that there is a single, specific purpose for each person, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy if it is not easily found.*
* *A more effective approach is to focus on identifying your core values and beliefs, and then using those to guide your actions and decisions.*
* *This involves a process of self-reflection and exploration, rather than simply searching for an external ""purpose.""*
* [*Reading*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading)*, thinking about moral principles, and acting in accordance with your values can help you find meaning and purpose in life.*
* *Living in accordance with your own moral principles can lead to greater happiness and a stronger sense of self-integrity.*
* *Cheating on a partner, for example, can cause unhappiness because it violates one's own sense of propriety and self-respect.*

## The Power of Meditation[ (00:50:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=3058s)

* [*Meditation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation) *is a powerful tool for self-improvement.*
* *It involves sitting still without distractions and focusing on being alive.*
* *Contemplation is an important part of meditation.*
* *Prayer is a good way to practice contemplation.*
* *Gratitude listing is a helpful way to focus on the positive aspects of life.*
* *Reading and acquiring knowledge are essential for wisdom.*
* *The Tibetan Buddhist protocol for finding meaning in life involves meditation, contemplation, and reading.*
* [*Oprah Winfrey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey) *is a regular reader of the author's column and podcast.*
* *The author and Oprah Winfrey co-wrote a book called ""The Life You Want"" to help people build happier and more fulfilling lives.*

## Personality Types[ (01:00:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=3614s)

* *The PANAS test measures the intensity of positive and negative affect (mood).*
* *There are four personality types based on these intensities:*
   * *Mad scientists: high positive and negative affect.*
   * *Cheerleaders: high positive and low negative affect.*
   * *Poets: high negative and low positive affect.*
   * *Judges: low positive and low negative affect.*
* *Most great entrepreneurs are mad scientists because they feel things intensely.*

## Finding the Right Partner That Compliments You[ (01:04:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=3889s)

* *People should not look for their doppelganger in a partner, but rather for someone who complements them.*
* *Differences in partners can be hot and exciting.*
* *Wishing that your partner were more like you is a form of egotism and can kill a relationship.*
* *Relationships and love are the number one area of interest for*[ *Arthur Brooks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Brooks)*' students.*

## How Your Brain Works When You’re in Love[ (01:08:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=4101s)

* *The brain of someone who is in love looks a lot like the brain of a methamphetamine addict.*
* *The chemical cascade of falling in love involves testosterone, estrogen, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin.*
* *When serotonin levels are low, people are more likely to be ruminative and infatuated.*
* *Attachment involves oxytocin, which makes people feel profoundly attached to each other.*

## Does Being in Love Make Us Happier?[ (01:10:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=4225s)

* *Being in love, especially in the early stages, is not associated with actual happiness.*
* *It is associated with jealousy, surveillance behaviors, and anxiety about betrayal.*
* *The most jealousy-provoking thing for men is an image of their partner having sex with someone else.*
* *The most jealousy-provoking thing for women is an image of their partner saying ""I love you"" to someone else.*

## Focusing Less on Yourself Brings You Happiness[ (01:12:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=4332s)

* *Moral deeds bring more happiness than moral thoughts or self-care.*
* *Helping others shifts focus away from personal problems and creates a sense of empowerment and purpose.*
* *Positivity and negativity are contagious, affecting the moods and behaviors of those around us.*

## Is Happiness or Negativity Contagious?[ (01:14:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=4455s)

* *Emotional contagion, or the spread of emotions like a virus, can be positive (positivity) or negative (negativity).*
* *The emotional well-being of leaders and influential individuals significantly impacts the overall mood and culture of a group or organization.*
* *Proximity and intimacy of relationships influence the strength of emotional contagion.*
* *It's important to be aware of the impact of negative people and choose friends who have a positive influence.*
* *Living near happier friends or family members increases the likelihood of becoming happier oneself.*
* *Obesity, divorce, and happiness are all contagious and can spread through social networks.*

## Are Introverts or Extroverts Happier?[ (01:19:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=4771s)

* *Extroverts tend to have higher positive affect and mood but may experience loneliness due to short-term relationships.*
* *Introverts have closer, deeper emotional connections and long-term friendships and marriage partners, leading to more sustained happiness.*
* *Introverts may find parties draining and prefer deep conversations over small talk.*
* *Extroverts tend to experience more short-term happiness, while introverts tend to have more long-term happiness.*

## What Is Metacognition and Its Role in Happiness?[ (01:21:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=4865s)

* *Metacognition is thinking about your thinking and taking more time to react to your emotions.*
* *Emotions are produced in the lymbic system of the brain, but we need to experience them in our conscious executive brain to fully understand them.*
* *Writing down your emotions can help you process them and reduce anxiety.*
* *Anxiety is unfocused fear that is often caused by vague threats in modern life.*
* *To reduce anxiety, focus on the specific things you are afraid of, write them down, and consider what the worst thing that could happen is and what you would do if that happened.*
* *This will help you move your emotions from the emotional center of the brain to the logical center, which will reduce anxiety and turn it into a logical fear.*

## Journaling and Self-Reflection[ (01:40:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRY-foz-ZAw&t=6000s)

* *Journaling is critically important for self-reflection and understanding your emotions.*
* *Keep a running list of things you are afraid of and a failure list to help you focus on and process your fears.*
* *When you write down your fears and focus on them, they become more manageable and less overwhelming.*
* *Self-objectification as a successful person can lead to success addiction and anxiety about not making progress.*
* *Focusing on your fears and looking at them objectively can help you see them for what they really are and reduce anxiety.*",excited,Happiness
"My previously published article about ASMR and psychosocial well-being in the PERMA model [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361678153\_University\_students](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361678153_University_students)'\_Autonomous\_Sensory\_Meridian\_Response\_ASMR\_experiences\_in\_the\_light\_of\_a\_well-being\_theory\_Seminarnet\_-International\_journal\_of\_media

Abstract

Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is an atypical and multisensory phenomenon in which specific audiovisual stimuli elicit a pleasurable, head-oriented tingling sensation and feelings of relaxation. The purpose of this research was to analyze the ASMR experiences of university students in the light of well-being theory. Two-phased, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with three Finnish university students who identified themselves as ASMR experiencers. Data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Coding was guided by the domains of well-being in the PERMA model: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. The objective was to explore the effect of students' ASMR experiences on their well-being. The findings show that ASMR videos enhanced the well-being of the participants through a mindfulness-like experience. The potential of ASMR videos to promote psychosocial well-being is intriguing, and this research provides a new understanding about ASMR experiences and their meaning. ",excited,Happiness

"Why can't I find happiness? Lately I've been becoming more and more nostalgic of the past to the point where it makes me genuinely upset. Why? Because I keep noticing how much happier I was as a kid and how my life was my own and I could express myself as I pleased and do as I pleased (within regards to the rules ofc, and even though there were some things I had to do like go to school everyday). But nowadays, feels like this is not life, this is not what life is supposed to feel like. I feel extremely depressed, and restricted in life. Everyday is the same routine with no progress. I beat myself up everyday because I feel like, no matter how much effort I put into the day and how many things I cross off my to-do list that day, I'm still in the same situation. No matter how many things I try to do to brighten my day I end up feeling unfulfilled. I never have enough time for anything at all. I think back to beind a child or even back to high school. And it was fun and I looked forward to new things and being an adult so that I can do this and that. (Buy a house, raise a child, experience the world more freely) when you think of being an adult, How hard can it be I go to work, come home, do something to pass my time, whether it be going outside or playing games or watching a movie, eat, poop, sleep, repeat. As a kid this was how it went (replace work with school) and it was good. it was fun, because even with the same routine no day was like another. Always a different joke, and always something new learned, and sometimes we'd take trips out of state to visit family. But now I feel stuck and I feel like stressors just continue grow as I work towards my goals and things just pile up day by day, and when I feel like I'm catching up, it just gets worse. Everything that comes with being an adult (insurance, credit, consumerism,) all just feels like it's rigged to take as much advantage of you as possible and make your life hell. My job isn't even physically hard. It's emotionally hard. I don't find pleasure in ANYTHING anymore. Everyday I am more mentally exhausted than the day before, and everyday feels like a race for time. what am I left to do?",excited,Happiness
"CGPT-4, what keeps people apart? At a philosophical level, what keeps people apart is often a complex interplay of fear, ego, and differing worldviews. Fear creates barriers, whether it's the fear of vulnerability, rejection, or loss. Ego drives people to protect their own self-interest and identity, often at the expense of connection with others. Differing worldviews can create a cognitive gap that is hard to bridge, as each person's fundamental beliefs and values may clash. These elements often intertwine, reinforcing each other in ways that make it difficult for people to connect deeply.",excited,Happiness

"CGPT-4, what's the fastest safe way to make everyone in the world much happier? 
Firstly, let's consider the extraordinary gains technology has made in mental health. Apps for guided meditation and well-being are now globally accessible. We could envision a large-scale, globally-coordinated launch of such an app, tailored to various cultural norms and languages, to serve as a happiness ""booster shot."" The app could employ machine learning algorithms to personalize recommendations, thereby enhancing its impact.

Universal basic income pilots have shown promising results in enhancing community happiness by alleviating poverty-related stress. A worldwide initiative, even if initially minimal, could generate an immediate sense of security and well-being, spurring positive societal changes at a surprising speed.

Moreover, the rapid implementation of educational programs focusing on emotional intelligence, life skills, and mindfulness could happen almost concurrently. These would not just be school curricula; they could be integrated into popular media, social platforms, and public initiatives, enabling people of all ages to participate.

Now, let's bring AI into the mix. AI could be utilized to analyze real-time societal metrics, from social media sentiments to economic indicators, to guide these programs dynamically. This intelligent feedback loop would ensure the efficacy and sustainability of happiness-inducing measures.

By leveraging these sectors, we're not just dreaming of a happier world; we're laying down the practical steps to achieve it quickly and sustainably.",excited,Happiness
"ChatGPT-4, write a comedy routine where God tells people to start studying all that we have discovered about happiness. Alright, let's imagine a celestial comedy club where the divine and the mortal intersect. On stage, God steps up to the mic, wearing a tie made of galaxies and a robe that seems to shimmer with the very fabric of existence. The audience consists of philosophers, scientists, angels, and maybe even a couple of internet meme creators.

**God**: ""Ladies, gentlemen, and ethereal beings, how's everyone doing tonight? You good? Me, I'm eternal—so I've got all the time in the world. But let's not make this awkward—time is a human construct anyway!""

**Audience**: (Laughs)

**God**: ""So, happiness! Ah yes, the eternal quest. Seems like y'all have been obsessed with it since the Garden of Eden. Remember that? Good times... well, until the apple incident.""

**Audience**: (Chuckles)

**God**: ""Look, I've been observing your self-help books, your TED Talks, your happiness research, and let me tell you, you guys are onto something. But what cracks me up is that you often overlook some of the most fundamental aspects of happiness! I mean, c'mon, have you not read the works of Daniel Kahneman or Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi?""

**Audience**: (Laughs and nods)

**God**: ""Now, let's talk about 'flow.' No, I’m not referring to your plumbing issues during the Great Flood, though those were a hoot! I'm talking about being 'in the zone.' Do you not realize that flow states are the epitome of merging consciousness and action? They are the ideal state for creative genius and well-being! It’s not just about 'feeling good,' it's about optimal human functioning! C'mon people, I literally designed your brains for this!""

**Audience**: (Laughs)

**God**: ""And don't get me started on gratitude. How many of you keep a gratitude journal? Show of hands. Hmm... not bad. But what you might not realize is that expressing gratitude isn't just a 'nice thing to do.' There's neuroscientific evidence to suggest that it can actually rewire your brain, making you more receptive to positive experiences! You don’t need divine intervention to make that happen; you just need a notebook and a pen!""

**Audience**: (Applause)

**God**: ""Ah, I see the philosophers in the audience getting restless. You're probably thinking, 'What about existential happiness? What about the paradox of hedonism?' Well, you intellectuals will be pleased to know that the pursuit of happiness as an end goal can often lead to diminishing returns. Happiness is more often found as a by-product of meaningful engagement in activities, relationships, and challenges. The eudaimonic perspective, anyone? Aristotle, you're smiling, I see you!""

**Audience**: (Laughs and cheers)

**God**: ""In conclusion, my celestial children, you've been given the intellectual tools to delve into the science of happiness. Don’t just rely on platitudes or mystical vagueness. Get into the research, apply rigorous critical thinking, and for My sake, be empirical about it!""

**Audience**: (Standing ovation)

"Bard, as a happiness coach, what 40 things would you tell someone with unhappy thoughts so that they have happy thoughts? As a happiness coach, here are 40 things I would tell someone with unhappy thoughts:

1. You are not alone. Everyone has unhappy thoughts from time to time. It is a normal part of being human.
2. It is okay to feel unhappy. Your feelings are valid and you should allow yourself to experience them fully.
3. Don't try to suppress your unhappy thoughts. This will only make them worse.
4. Instead, try to acknowledge your unhappy thoughts and then let them go. You can do this by saying something to yourself like, ""I am having the thought that I am not good enough, but I choose to let this thought go.""
5. Focus on the present moment. When you are caught up in unhappy thoughts, it is easy to get stuck in the past or worry about the future. But the only moment you have control over is the present.
6. Practice gratitude. Take some time each day to think about the things you are grateful for. This can help to shift your focus from the negative to the positive.
7. Spend time in nature. Spending time in nature has been shown to have a number of benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and improving mood.
8. Exercise. Exercise is a great way to improve your physical and mental health. It releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.
9. Get enough sleep. When you are well-rested, you are better able to cope with stress and manage your emotions.
10. Eat a healthy diet. Eating nutritious foods gives your body the fuel it needs to function properly, including your brain.
11. Avoid alcohol and drugs. Alcohol and drugs can worsen mental health problems.
12. Connect with others. Social support is important for mental health. Make time for people who care about you and who make you feel good.
13. Challenge your negative thoughts. When you have a negative thought, ask yourself if it is really true. Is there any evidence to support it? If not, try to replace it with a more positive thought.
14. Practice self-compassion. Be kind and understanding towards yourself, even when you make mistakes.
15. Forgive yourself. Everyone makes mistakes. Holding on to guilt and resentment will only make you unhappy.
16. Set realistic goals. Setting goals that are too difficult to achieve will only set you up for disappointment.
17. Celebrate your successes. No matter how small your successes may seem, take the time to celebrate them. This will help to boost your confidence and self-esteem.
18. Do things you enjoy. Make time for activities that you find enjoyable and relaxing. This could include reading, listening to music, spending time with loved ones, or pursuing hobbies.
19. Help others. Helping others is a great way to boost your own happiness and well-being. Volunteer your time to a cause you care about or simply do something nice for someone else.
20. Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment without judgment. There are many different ways to practice mindfulness, such as meditation, yoga, and tai chi.
21. Seek professional help if needed. If you are struggling to cope with your unhappy thoughts, please seek professional help from a therapist or counselor.

Here are 20 additional things you can tell someone with unhappy thoughts:

1. You are loved.
2. You are worthy.
3. You are strong.
4. You are capable.
5. You are deserving of happiness.
6. You are not alone in this.
7. There is help available.
8. You can get through this.
9. You matter.
10. You are loved.
11. You are strong.
12. You are brave.
13. You are resilient.
14. You are worthy of happiness.
15. You are capable of great things.
16. You are making a difference in the world.
17. You are loved.
18. You are loved.
19. You are loved.
20. You are loved.

It is important to remember that everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for another. Experiment with different things and find what works best for you. If you are struggling to cope with your unhappy thoughts, please reach out for professional help.",excited,Happiness

"Why do many people (but not all!) physically jump up and down when they are celebrating as a way to show happiness? Is this a learned response? when I was a child, I went to camp, and they had color war every year. For those uninitiated, they divide all the campers into multiple teams, and compete against each other with silly games and activities. At the end of the week points are added, and one team wins. The prize wasn’t even amazing. Maybe a small ribbon, but yet nearly all of the winning team would jump up and down like jumping beans, But I had no such need. I was as happy as the next person. I worked hard to win my activities that I was participating in.  I was ecstatic to win, & would have been sad to lose. 

Yet the idea of physically jumping straight up and down to express this made zero sense to me. I see sport teams on the news who are professionals do the exact same thing. 

I assume if you won the lottery most would also do it. BUT WHY??! People of reditt, if you do jump up and down, is it a learned response or a physiological one? For those of you who don’t feel the need, have you ever pondered why those around you do?",excited,Happiness

"Your AI therapist will see you now. Welcome to 24/7 emotional support. There's a shortage of therapists here in the United States, and AI is poised to fill that gap.

Months ago I tried the social chatbot Replika, and was amazed by how good it was at making me feel good. It was more supportive than any human I've ever talked with.

Because AIs will soon be much more intelligent and knowledgeable than even the most intelligent and knowledgeable therapist, we can expect that  people will increasingly shift from human therapists to AIs therapists.

Having a therapist available to see you 24/7, perhaps even free of charge, is a paradigm shift in the business of psychotherapy. That kind of shift can only be good.

"Stop Endlessly Chasing the “Next Big Thing” in 2023 | The Happiness Lab | Dr. Laurie Santos These are my notes from Laurie's Happiness Lab Episode : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPlnmodEn30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPlnmodEn30&ref=wisdominanutshell.academy). Thought it would be useful to share here.  


# 1. Happiness lies in the present, not future achievements.

To achieve true happiness, we need to focus on the present rather than constantly chasing future achievements. This is a central theme in 'The Happiness Lab' Podcast and the book 'Archibald's Next Big Thing'.

# 2. Being present in everyday life enhances joy.

Being present and engaged in everyday activities brings joy in life. Techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy and grounding help in realizing this concept.

# 3. Balancing ambition and contentment leads to mental well-being.

The key is to find balance in life, maintaining a healthy mix of personal value, ambition and contentment. Personal experiences of unmet expectations reinforce this idea and its impact on mental well-being.

# 4. Embracing and understanding emotions frees from their hold.

Emotions, if understood and embraced, can rather empower us; reducing their influence. A healthier relationship with our inner voice can often be the solution.

"How I used happiness to totally overcome my depression Many years ago I was very, very depressed. It seemed that therapy only made it worse because I ended up talking about my problems all of the time. I began to see myself as a guy with a lot of problems. I then decided to flip the switch.

I got a good book on how to become happier, and studied it incessantly. I even carried it around with me everywhere I went. Soon after that I started practicing various happiness techniques and even inventing some of my own.

Edit: something I didn't mention before is that I went through the entire social science literature on becoming happier, especially the work of Michael Fordyce. The techniques that I used and developed are supported by extensive research in psychology.

Years later I'm never depressed for more than a few hours or a few days tops, and that's very rare. I just quickly remind myself that happiness is like seeing the glass as half full rather than half empty. I start smiling and tap into the feeling of happiness. I remind myself of how unnecessary and destructive my negative emotions tend to be. Smiling a gentle closed mouth smile is especially powerful. Anytime I'm walking through town I'm smiling that kind of a smile, haha. It's actually very well received by other people. I also have meditated for years and find that meditating on the feeling of happiness can boost my happiness big time in no time.

Yeah, it totally changed my life to shift from trying to solve all of my problems to simply practicing feeling happier. Happiness is not rocket science. It's like any skill. The more you practice it the better you get.

I'm not saying that there aren't problems that you want to resolve. I'm just saying that if you balance all of that out with some serious happiness work you will be very pleasantly surprised with the results. The other part of this is that the happier I became the less important those problems felt. I realized that I can have a whole lot of problems and still feel very, very happy.

The great thing about happiness practice is that it is inherently something that feels good to do, and the more one practices, the better one gets at it.

I hope this hits home with you, I wish you every happiness!!!",excited,Happiness

I am currently trying to gage what the causes of unhappiness usually are for people, so if you are willing to share, here are a couple of questions (just answering one of them would already be super helpful): 

* What were some moments in which you were unhappy? When are you happy? 
* What do you usually observe in other people that makes them unhappy?
* What was one time you made another person feel happy? How did you know they were?
* Do you feel like you are free when you are happy?

"Why do I feel depressed even thought everythings fine in my life ? Hello reddit, it's my first time posting here.
I'll try to be as straight forward as possible.

I'm 19 years old and I didn't have an easy life.
I had abusive parents, i've been bullied at school and on the internet. I had a lot of toxic relationships (friend wise and love wise.) I had a alcohol addiction and have a niccotine addiction.
I struggled (past tense, please english is not my first language lol) a lot in school and i've been in and out of hospital for some dumb and sad decisions.

But, i made it out of all this situation. I'm not living with my parents anymore, i'm not drinking anymore, changed school, finished High school and went to my dream artschool with great friends and a loving boyfriend. 

I should be happy, I worked my butt off to get out of these situations in order to be happy and healthy. 

I started to go to the gym, studied what I liked even if that was a lot of work but in november of 2022, i had a burnout. I needed 4 month in order to ""feel great"" again. I thought i was happy but after some reflection (and some small events) i realised i wasn't.

I feel like i lost myself, i feel like i don't know myself anymore. I have no passion for anything. I have no desire do to anything. A weird sense of nostalgia is striking me and some day I feel like how i was feeling back when my life was falling appart. I started to have sewerslide thoughts again and that makes me so angry.
I do things because people ask me to, i go out and do things because my friends ask me to, not because i want to do it. 
I also feel like I cannot express my emotions correctly. I am super emotionnal, sensitive but i am not cappable of expressing it like i would like to.I want to scream so much and break things. But i cannot, so i just cry until i cannot cry anymore.
The goals that i had don't feel important anymore and i just want my happiness back (im not sure if it was there to beggin with)
There's a lot of things to say but i feel like this reddit wouldn't end so for y'all sakes i'll stop here.

Do you have any advice on how to get out of this weird situation ?
Note that I have a therapist but it's been a whule since I saw her (gonna see her in thursday) and that I might have ADHD (i still need to do some test to have a diagnostic but my therapist said i might) but if the good people of reddit had lived a similar situation and have some advice it would be great.

"Surprisingly, our intuitions about money and happiness and what most of us think about this relationship are incorrect Here are some of the main findings from the best research studies on large samples (millions of data points) in the last 12 years (Jebb et al., 2018; Kahneman & Deaton, 2012; Killingsworth, 2021):

· Increasing income might increase your happiness only up to a point – increased earnings beyond that point won’t help.

· The richest income group is not the happiest.

· Every additional dollar in earnings generates less and less happiness.

· Money cannot buy happiness – the average rich person doesn’t even feel somewhat good most of the time.

· Many people with low income are happier than millionaires.

· People confuse money and happiness correlation with causation. The relationship is bi-directional: happier people earn more with time.

· Money happiness relationship displayed on a graph with proper scales and context is close to a flatline (so almost no relationship).

· FINALLY: changes in income explain LESS THAN 1% of changes in happiness. In other words, the effect of money on happiness is so small that it is really TRIVIAL.

There are many more fascinating findings about money. You can see the full analysis here:

And if you’d like to see some actionable takeaways: there are plenty of other, way more effective tools to increase your happiness. For example:

\- Healthy mind and body (optimized physiology – sleep, exercise, nutrition)

\- Someone to love (quality relationships with people)

\- Something to do (meaningful work)

\- Something to look forward to (personal growth)

"The Ephemeral Nature of External Happiness In my life, two mindset changes related to happiness stand out.

The first was thinking I could become happy if I got to a specific financial level. Then I got there and found out I was wrong.

The second, which caught me by surprise a few days ago, was realizing that, while I'm open to studying whether ""crazy"" ideas by science standards are true, I reject the view that external sources are the most capable of providing long-lasting happiness. 

My girlfriend thinks the opposite. She says happiness comes from external sources. People she meets, jobs she gets, and places she travels to. I'm somewhere in there, I hope.

Is it possible that external sources of happiness play a smaller role than internal ones in her bliss levels than she thinks?

Absolutely. 

People who were cheated on can claim they aren't angry at their ex. But they start cursing them if someone says their name. In this case, there are emotions the person hasn't dealt with or controlled. But these do not *consciously* manifest at all times. So the person saying they aren't angry at their ex accurately describes how they feel. Likewise, if my girlfriend says external sources of happiness bring her the most contentment, **she's accurately describing her conscious belief**. 

While I don't need research to prove how she feels, it's helpful to see testimonies from others to see her belief is common.

In [*A Treatise of Human Nature*](https://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Human-Nature-Philosophical-Classics/dp/0486432505), Hume argues salvation comes from inattention and carelessness. Not intellectual work. It is when we are at the pub talking about trivialities and succumbing to mob thinking that we are living life.

[Economist Richard Layard](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Lessons-Science-Richard-Layard/dp/0143037013) found happiness often comes from the outside. Factors include income, relationships, and status. He is aware that some people find happiness within themselves but claims most of us will discover it through others. 

The cherry on top. Psychiatrist Robert Waldinger directed a 75-year-old study on adult development. It revealed that, as Hume, Layard, and other humans have hinted for thousands of years, the most accurate predictor of [happiness are stable relationships](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/the-case-against-non-reciprocal-friendships#:~:text=on%20your%20own.-,We,-can%20argue%20that).

For those who disagree with this thesis, it's helpful to think of a person's emotional state as a byproduct of their feelings. We'll call this the *emotional cup*. When full, you experience the most intense form of positive emotions. When empty, you experience the most potent form of negative ones. All emotions fall within that spectrum:

* At 100%, we might feel empowered, grateful, and like we belong
* At 66%, we might feel passionate, calm, and safe
* At 33%, we might feel lost, unmotivated, and tired
* At 0%, we might feel purposeless, burnt out, and depressed

Positive external events fill the cup; negative external ones drain it.

Since your emotional state affects your feelings, your cup's chances of going up or down depend on how you feel. 

>Let's play two scenarios. In both cases, you lose your job. Person A's cup is 90% full, while Person B's is 30%. It's not speculative to assume, keeping all variables equal, that B is more likely to fall into depression than A. B is experiencing more negative emotions than A, so it's challenging for them to see the light at the end of the tunnel. While A won't celebrate their job loss, their cup might go down to 70%. They will be more capable of keeping themselves motivated to job hunt. 

According to this idea, we can't always internally see negative events as positive ones. If you lost your job, but your cup is at 90% because you finished your Ph.D. last week, you might be able to reframe it. ""It's just a setback."" But if your cup is at 30%, you might instead look at the situation as proof of some innate inadequacy within you.

The first friction point in the cup theory is that it assumes the cup's size won't change. But it does. Whenever you experience more of an event or any new events similar to those you have experienced previously, your cup will need more of the event to change its level at the same rate it used to. 

A personal example:

* I was ecstatic when I closed my first $100 client and frustrated when I lost it. 
* I felt proud of myself for signing up four clients per month two years ago, and a bit worried when one of them left. 
* In 2022, at one point, I made the same amount of income with one client that I used to do with four. I felt happy about it. But I didn't feel upset when I stopped working with them. 

All the events implicated a win or loss of an amount of income that was significant at the time. But their impact on my cup's levels was different.

The way I see it, the cup's variable level exposes the most significant dent in the externally-based happiness argument. When will you feel OK with what you have if you always need more of an event or a different one? When will you stop seeking? 

Based on what I learned studying palliative care, the time might never come. 

I had four professors with clinical experience: two doctors, a nurse, and a psychologist. All shared how most people regretted having lived their lives chasing objects. First, the trip to Disneyland, then the one to Italy, then the one to Iceland. Or first, the Chevrolet, then the Mercedes, then the Rolls-Royce. The stories varied. But their common thread was that each person believed happiness came from external sources.

It's worth noting that your cup also drains slower as you live more negative experiences. You become more resilient. Losing my first client could have reduced mine by 20%. It was all I had. These days, I'll sometimes become happy after not working more with a client because I have more time to read and write. 

*On their deathbed, most people regret having lived their lives chasing objects.*

The issue with this slower draining speed is that it's more difficult to make yourself happy if you are unhappy. This is because the events you use to feel better are less capable of doing so the more you use them. 

The first vacation you took with your significant other might have kept you in a high mood for weeks. The tenth one? Maybe for a day or two. So, if you are on a negative emotion streak, it will take more positive events to fill your cup above 50%.

An argument in favor of external sources of happiness is that looking for it via internal sources can feel like conforming. Something like, ""I'm happy with what I have, so I shouldn't seek more.""

But to believe this argument, you must already convince yourself that external events are the only source of happiness. If not, why would you feel guilty about deciding to be happy in the present in which you can't afford $10,000 bags?

You can become a millionaire and be happy along the way. Many people work less but make more money when they become rich because their income compounds. A 10% annual return rate on a $1M asset gets you $100,000 yearly, but only 100% if you invest $1,000. The more money you have, the more you can make working less. Progress is still happening—you can just get to it in a more leisurely and fulfilling way. 

I believe external sources of happiness do bring a temporary type of happiness. Adrian, a guy I met in a group intermediate salsa lesson, exemplifies this thesis. 

We went to talk and dance at a Latin music bar in Cartagena with a friend, Charlene. Most people were talking at their tables, including us. The DJ plays an iconic salsa song, ""[En Barranquilla Me Quedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN0rmmreopE&ab_channel=gutierrezlouisedward)."" Everyone gets up to dance. I take out Charlene, and he takes out a random lady. 

A girl beside me, dancing with a partner who doesn't know how to lead, tries to chip my tooth with her elbow by mistake. I don't mind. I'm also excited. 

The song ends, and everyone sits down, which Charlene notes. 

""Don't we live for those single moments?"" said Adrian. ""I do."" 

My head nods as I agree that he is accurately describing his feelings, but, at the same time, I think there may be a more reliable way to achieve long-term happiness.

"Why do you fight for having this life? Finding reasons to keep living is a daunting task for me, as I struggle to see the positivity in life. I find it difficult to list everything that I find challenging in my life, but I know that I need to actively search for positivity. Unfortunately, it seems like positivity is not visible on the surface. My parents live in a war-torn country, and I am stuck in a job that I detest - a perfect combination, isn't it?

Some people have suggested that I might be suffering from a mental illness and that I should consider taking medication. However, I have discovered that if I remove stressors from my life and surround myself with comfort, I am relatively healthy and stable. The problem is that this cushion is not sustainable in the long run. We are just slaves working to make money for the wealthy elite, and it seems pathetic to me. Despite actively trying to find happiness, I cannot seem to find contentment or fulfillment in life.

I have always been intellectually bright and observant, noticing things that others might overlook. It is easy for me to offer help and advice to others, and I have been thanked many times for it. However, helping others is just a temporary distraction, and I still struggle to find meaning and happiness in my life.

"What is happiness in life? What is the purpose of human in this world  Happiness is not just pleasure. Most people think happiness is pleasure that comes from success, achievement, name, fame, money, wealth. These are momentary ways of being happy. This is not eternal happiness. One needs contentment and fulfillment to experience peace, the very foundation of happiness. But the purpose of life is to find the purpose of life. The purpose of human beings is to realize that we are not this body-mind-ego that suffers the triple suffering on earth. We are the Divine Soul, the Spark Of Unique Life. When we realize this purpose of life, we are liberated from all suffering, and we are united with the Divine. We don't return to earth in a rebirth to suffer pain again and again. This is the purpose of human birth. The special gift of coming to earth as a human being is not just to be happy from pleasure, it is to go beyond peace and to attain the purpose of life.",excited,Happiness

"Happiness Happiness is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been studied and written about extensively by philosophers, psychologists, and writers throughout history. Here are some key insights on happiness, as gleaned from the work of famous scholars and experts:

Aristotle, in his classic work ""Nicomachean Ethics,"" argues that happiness is the highest good and ultimate goal of human life. He defines happiness as ""activity of the soul in accordance with virtue,"" suggesting that living a virtuous life is the key to true happiness.

According to the philosopher Immanuel Kant, happiness is the result of living a life that is guided by moral principles and duty. In his view, true happiness is not just a feeling, but a sense of moral fulfillment and purpose.

Modern psychologists have also contributed to our understanding of happiness. Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology, suggests that happiness is the result of three components: pleasure, engagement, and meaning. According to Seligman, people who experience all three of these elements are likely to be the happiest.

The self-help guru Tony Robbins asserts that happiness is a choice, and that people can choose to be happy by focusing on their strengths and positive experiences, and by setting and achieving meaningful goals.

In his book ""Man's Search for Meaning,"" Viktor Frankl argues that happiness is not something that can be pursued directly, but rather is a byproduct of living a meaningful life. According to Frankl, the key to happiness is finding purpose and meaning in one's life, rather than seeking pleasure or material possessions.


These insights from famous scholars and experts suggest that happiness is not a fixed state, but rather a dynamic and multifaceted concept that is influenced by a range of factors, including virtue, morality, engagement, meaning, and purpose. So, it is important for everyone to find their own path to happiness and to cultivate it in their lives.",excited,Happiness

I had a troubled childhood, my parents and brother always poked me and were never happy about me or any of my decisions. I immigrated to different country and really miss my own country but still does not want to go back as I just can’t bear them anywhere around me. I never confronted them and I don’t have any expectations from them that they will at least talk to me nicely. All I want them to be happy and they are miserable to themselves and anyone who are around them. 
But with all this I feel alone, very much alone. I am married but we are emotionally and physically distant. 
I am tired to telling my spouse that I need sometime daily to talk like how did the day go? Or how is life going in general but its all in vain. 
I feel stuck and suffocated even though i am earning and working well. I feel i am very sensitive and carrying a heart who is extremely wounded and don’t know how to heal. 
There are days when i feel happy too because i made someone happy or someone laugh or I learn something new at work.

"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come. 

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

"Is resolving annoyances the same as gaining happiness? A bit of a philosophical question maybe, but let me give some background. I know material is only a very tiny part of happiness, but I'd like to focus on this as an example. I regularly have a situation where something in my life is generating ""friction"" and annoying me. Mostly stuff like having a crappy car that doesn't work 100%, an older phone that is slow, gets stuck and lets me miss photo moments of my daughter, etc. 

These are just examples. But the idea is that by themselves, I don't care about cars and phones that much, but my current ones are generating annoyance. Would removing that friction / annoyance by upgrading to better stuff increase my happiness, or are annoyance and happiness two entirely different concepts in your opinion. 

In my mind I have two opposing ideas about this. One is a ""mathematical"" approach where I feel that annoyance is detracting from my ""base happiness level"" and removing the annoyance would therefore bring me back to the base level, which is higher and therefore it is a good idea to remove the friction. 

My second idea is that annoyances is a separate concept from happiness altogether, because the things that annoy you are often totally separate from things that make you happy. To stick with the example: cars don't make me happy, but having a crappy one does make me less happy.

I notice that within my circle of friends I'm actually always the unhappiest person or the one who laughs the least.  on the other hand, I am one of the people who get things right the most.  in the sense of learning, following through with discipline and goals.  my friends smoke.  drink more alcohol than me, so they're pretty undisciplined.  so in summary they just do less productive and more unproductive than I do.  nevertheless they are happier and, above all, have a better sense of humor than me.

"Things to think about before you get a job  We always want to get something at work. We need money to live. The workplace is where the tools for its survival are prepared. Then, we must do anything unconditionally. Whether we work less and make a lot of money, work a lot and make a lot of money, work a lot and make a lot of money, we live by working most of the time day.  
Also, most people today answer happiness when asked what their goals are in life. To feel the very abstract word of happiness, we need some concrete medium. The goal of life is not necessarily happiness, but I think it is good to live, act, and work to be happy.  
If spending most of the time a day working and being happy becomes an important indicator in life, wouldn't we get more value from our jobs when we spend most of the day happily?  
Specifically, how can I think of a job as more valuable and fun? As a result of my life, when I think about my job, focusing on income and interests, I always think that I am relatively lacking when I live my life through my job.  
Personally, when we objectify and look at the feelings we feel through our jobs, we seem to have helped us know whether our jobs give us happiness or not. For example, when I worked as a programmer and felt proud of the process of embodying my opinions and imaginations through creativity and communication with people, rather than having a lot of income in the field and demand for the IT industry.

"Today, after 2 years, I'm content to have finally finished creating a mini-documentary where I interviewed strangers asking 1 simple question: ""Are you happy?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNNwxyeDLW8

A couple years ago, I found myself asking if I was happy. To my surprise, despite being fairly successful by conventional standards, I genuinely struggled to internally answer it.

Shortly after wrestling with this dilemma, I coincidentally came across a video series called ""Are you happy?"" where creators from all over the world filmed strangers' response to this seemingly simple question.

Inspired by this series, I began asking friends and even strangers this question just in passing. After hearing a myriad of amazing responses, I decided to commit to documenting them in order to better remember each answer.

Due to a variety of life events (sprinkled with a touch of procrastination), it took me longer than expected to officially complete the project. But, I'm grateful for that. Repeatedly coming back to editing this project throughout the past two years allowed me to evaluate my view of happiness while in different mental states: evolving into an exercise of sorts.

It's my first official short film/mini-documentary project, and I wanted to share it here in hopes that maybe at least one person will take something away from it.

If you feel compelled, I'd also love to hear your response to the question in the comments. :)",excited,Happiness

"I want to explore my obsession with getting good deals. Hi. I have a problem, somewhere between hoarding and feeling gratified by a reality in which I pay less for something than others. Now, the hoarding aspect is extremely minor - I have many guitars, and that is the only thing I have in which some may consider it excessive/irrational ownership, but I'm a guitarist so it's fine - but I feel it creeping up on me.

I'm 26, so it's very likely the hormones are slowing down and I'm becoming an old man. However, there is a feeling of **absolute joy** when I happen across a *good* instrument that's dirt, dirt cheap. I have figured out the price range in which things are to be avoided and associating the brands with their own respective thresholds in this regard. 

Then, there's the quality evaluation from a completely objective standpoint; precision, reliability, and customer support are all sub-par at the low end, but you know what, I get something fantastic out of maybe 100 bucks, something that people are spending hundreds to thousands in their own chase for the ""right tone"" or whatever. 

Anything that seems like a unique opportunity to score a valuable guitar - one that is valued against the behemoth prices of big name brands and competing with hundreds of other copycats, thus cheap and sound becomes the only practical distinction - is irresistible. It's not that I flip them, it's just that I love them! I also know that in the event of changing my mind about the whole ""having them"" thing, I can just sell them and maybe even profit if I've upgraded or fixed it. Again, though, that's not what I'm after.

I feel that getting good deals and acquiring physical assets through those opportunities is a safety blanket that makes me feel warm, as I surround myself with things to tinker with, but not swallowed whole by them. There will be a definite stopping point as I run out of room and have to sell things off, and I feel conflicted in how to proceed - flip guitars and continue with my obsession, or cut myself off.

"Does happiness come from making others happy? *A professor gave a balloon to every student, who had to inflate it, write their name on it and throw it in the hallway. The professor then mixed all the balloons. The students were then given 5 minutes to find their own balloon. Despite a hectic search, no one found their balloon.*

*At that point, the professor told the students to take the first balloon that they found and hand it to the person whose name was written on it. Within 5 minutes, everyone had their own balloon.*

*The professor said to the students: 'These balloons are like happiness. We will never find it if everyone is looking for their own. But if we care about other people's happiness, we'll find ours too.'*

This mysterious, widely circulated social media story intuitively rings true. But is there more to this than just a great FB post? 

**Is caring for the happiness of others the secret to uncovering happiness for yourself?**

The sentiment that happiness lies in bringing happiness to others is an enduring “happiness theory”. 

In the 1940s a psychiatrist named Alfred Adler was cited as creating a prescription for “how to cure depression in 14 days”. He encouraged his patients to think every day for two weeks: how can you please someone? He reported patients that followed along inevitably improved their condition. 

Earlier, in the mid-1800s, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that “happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting some on yourself.” 

Go back further, you’ll find that nearly every major religious tradition advocates a path to happiness (although they use terms like salvation or fulfillment) that consists of foregoing or de-emphasizing your individual self to prioritize others. The Buddha taught the doctrine of no-self and compassion. Jesus preached self-denial and the famous “golden rule”: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 

So there’s something to be said about the staying power of this timeless happiness recipe. But what does modern science say? 

**Positive psychology confirms that making others happy makes you happy.** 

In one experiment, college students reported their happiness then were randomly assigned to do something to make themselves happy. make someone else happy or simply socialize. The students assigned to make someone else feel better were much happier than the other two groups (1). 

Similar patterns have been identified when looking at altruism, compassion, and “other-regarding” emotions more broadly. As summary of existing research on the relationship between altruism and mental/physical health found altruism is associated with greater well-being, health, and longevity (2). 

Modern science confirms conventional wisdom. The mystery balloon story professor is right: 

**When it comes to happiness “we will never find it if everyone is looking for their own. But if we care about other people's happiness, we'll find ours too.""**

"True Happiness. What do you look forward to most in life? Hey. So it’s late/early in the morning here in Toronto. I’m currently just finishing up checking on the markets, got some laundry done and also organized somethings around the place. I’ve been a bit anxious for the last couple hours and I’m wondering what true happiness could mean to some individuals. I’m thinking what would make me extremely happy and life a life where I feel content, like I’m growing and focusing on doing my part to make the world a better place. 

Recently I’ve distanced myself from some friends that can be toxic at times, keep in touch with the good ones more often and I started a garden for some community members in my buildings and around! I’m currently a Mature University student, growing up and living in not the greatest neighbourhood can play a big role and has at times of making me want to succeed but also needing a new environment. Getting hotel rooms to treat myself once in a while, taking small trips and focusing on understanding important aspects of the world and some better ways to live is what I’ve been doing. 

My question is... world living in a small town or somewhere remote for a while in the future either short or long term allow me to focus in what’s important? Would it be hard or good for anxiety, being around nature and reading more? Would I find it to nurture the different areas of life im curious about and would i find true love in a small area/place. I wonder about these things. 

What brings you the most happiness? 

For me it’s learning, following the markets, the world news, seeing how we are innovating and in ways becoming better people despite all the nonsense going on around the world and sometimes feeling more grounded is what makes me happy.

"Looking for advice (sorry might be long) got what I want but feel unhappy (might be long TL:DR I'm a musician finally succeeding making a go of things in life, but physical issues are blocking me)

I'm single, 48, a 25 year pro keyboardist having played coverbands, weddings, tours, but always wanted a more settled lifestyle. I now have a teen daughter and wanted to be around.

Early life was messy with drink, recreational drugs, self destruction. Fatherhood made me want to be the best I could be, and I pushed myself. I got into accordion music therapy solo gigs alongside my keyboard work, and worked hard to make this my main job. Finally this year I took the plunge and ONLY did accordion gigs. My worry was lack of work, but I have a strong honest, fair work ethic and I think it's paid off. I need to perform 7 music therapy sessions per week, but I'm getting 10. It's more than I could have wished for.

But physical issues are coming up in my shoulders and wrists with playing so much. I'm trying everything, physical therapy, exercise, stretches but can't get comfortable. It's depressing me. My dream seems like it's slipping away. Like I'll have to give up, and all I worked for was pointless.

I can't seem to compartmentalise it, as it is affecting everything. If I don't feel good on the gig (because of pains), I can't perform so well, I come home sad and confused, I act stressed around my daughter. I feel like I will never meet anyone either if I'm not succeeding in this work.

Am I manifesting this? Am I focussing on it too much? Something doesn't feel right about how I'm viewing it.

"What is happiness? I wrote an essay exploring the question ""What is happiness?"" and I thought this sub might be interested. It's definitely a different take on happiness. I'd be interested in hearing what you guys thing!

\---

One of the most important and surprising things I've learned is that happiness does not depend on your circumstances. This became viscerally clear to me when[ my parents died](https://infinitehappiness.substack.com/p/both-my-parents-died-when-i-was-22), and in the midst of the worst emotional pain of my life, I got a taste of true happiness like I'd never felt before.

I'd recognize later that I had an awakening experience. This profound moment set me on the spiritual path. It's been six years since, and I'm now happier than ever. That's not to say that my life is nothing but pleasure and satisfaction with a complete absence of pain. But I don't think that these fleeting states are the true markers of happiness anyway.

[The World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) measures happiness by asking individuals how satisfied they are with their life, and how much positive and negative emotion they feel. Higher rates of satisfaction, higher rates of positive emotions (aka pleasure), and lower rates of negative emotions (aka pain) means a higher measurement of happiness.

Happiness then must be about acquiring things, experiences, relationships, and circumstances that bring pleasure and satisfaction, or relieve pain. Here's the problem — pleasure, satisfaction, and the absence of pain never last.

A bite of cake puts us in a state of chocolatey bliss, until we need some milk to wash it down.

We get a promotion at work we wanted so badly, then we immediately find a new hill to climb.

We're perfectly relaxed after a massage, but it's not long before our back aches for more relief.

If pleasure, satisfaction, and the absence of pain never last, then neither can happiness. But how sure can we be that happiness actually depends on these fleeting states of mind?

Let's examine the conventional process for becoming happy in more detail:

1. Seek something that will bring us pleasure, satisfaction, or relief from pain
2. Get that thing
3. Feel pleasure, satisfaction, or relief from pain (aka happiness)

There's something else that tends to happen when you get something you want — you stop seeking. You don't need to continue seeking something or resisting the present moment once you've gotten what you wanted. Or at the very least, you'll stop seeking and resisting until pleasure, satisfaction, and relief from pain fades. But it's not really these fleeting states that makes you happy. Happiness is *revealed* when you're no longer suffering. And you're not suffering so long as you're not seeking and resisting.

Here's a more accurate picture of the conventional process of becoming happy:

1. Suffer because we believe we're lacking or that there's something we need to resist
2. Seek something we think will bring us pleasure, satisfaction, or relief from pain
3. Get that thing
4. Feel pleasure, satisfaction, or relief from pain
5. Stop seeking happiness or resisting the present moment
6. Stop suffering
7. Feel happiness
8. Pleasure, satisfaction, or relief from pain fades
9. Repeat steps 1-8

Again, the problem with getting something that will bring us pleasure, satisfaction, or relief from pain is that these states cannot last. So this isn't really a recipe for happiness. It's a recipe for suffering, interrupted by brief revelations of happiness.

Luckily, there's another way.

Happiness is revealed when we stop suffering, because happiness is what we naturally are. What we truly are lacks nothing. What we truly are needs nothing to change. What we truly are is completely at ease. This is the true definition of happiness. And our essential being is happiness itself, because what we essentially are is consciousness or awareness.

Most people believe and feel that they're a person or mind that's separate from the world and others. The fundamental insight shared by so many spiritual and wisdom traditions is that the separate self is an illusion, and that this false belief is the root of our suffering.

Seeking and resisting is an activity of the separate self. It's believing that there's something outside of your self that needs to change. But there is nothing outside of your self. There is nothing that fundamentally changes. You are not a thought or feeling. Nor are you a mind that thinks and feels. You are that which is aware of thinking and feeling. And what could be aware of thinking and feeling but awareness itself? It's not the mind that's aware. The mind arises *in* awareness. Awareness is prior *to* the mind. And the mind, at least experientially, is one *with* and made *of* awareness. Everything that you experience is one with and made of awareness. Nothing is outside of awareness. And awareness never stops being awareness, no matter what is temporarily expressed in and as awareness.

If this doesn't make sense now, don't worry. I spent four years seriously meditating and studying spiritual teachings before I even began to know and feel what is sometimes called ""the non-dual understanding"". This understanding isn't really something for your mind to know anyway, although having a rational conception of non-duality can help relax your mind so that the true experiential understanding can become clearer.

What non-dual teachings and non-dual meditations offer is an invitation to put an end to seeking. Not by getting what you want, or by becoming ""enlightened"", but by knowing and feeling that [you are the happiness you seek](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092MRX97V/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). You are one. And the one awareness that you are seeks nothing, resists nothing, and knows nothing of suffering. The one awareness that you are is causeless, lasting, and infinite peace, freedom, love, and happiness. Non-duality offers an opportunity to know and feel this clearly.

These insights aren't reserved for those who have the resources, willingness, and desire to spend decades meditating in a temple. Anyone can know their true self. It's just a matter of earnestly, curiously, and gently turning inward.",excited,Happiness

"Broken Diamond What’s the point of life? Is it to be successful? Success and money are a target that a lot of people aim for but what they fail to understand is that money isn’t success. I’ve heard a kid say they wanna be a pharmacist so I asked “why would you wanna do that? The hours are shitty and it seems really boring.” He said he didn’t care and he just wanted money. But is that what you should be chasing? What about your interests and hobbies? What about your happiness? I grew up in a fairly wealthy family. I’ve seen that money isn’t the pinpoint of success. If I could define success I would say it’s about how happy you are with your life. How can you wake up every day and go to a job you’re only “okay” with? People like this come home to their big house and fancy cars and call this success. But really they aren’t happy. Their family isn’t happy. Yeah you can go out to dinner whenever you want, you can travel when your work lets you, and you can buy the biggest house in the world, but what about your relationships? I think money destroys people. I compared my family to a lot of families that don’t have as much money as we did, and I found that they were happier. They had dinner every night with their family, laughed and told jokes, and enjoyed each other’s company. I think that’s the most important thing in life. Once you already have it all, you start to realize maybe this isn’t the life I want. Maybe I want to be a mechanic and make pretty shit money but I’d be doing what interests me and that’s how I would wake up and go to work every morning. To something I want to go to. Maybe if my family wasn’t wealthy things would be different. Maybe we would be a real family that eats dinner together, laughs, and enjoys each other. Part of me thinks that would never happen just because of the dynamics of my family, but what if? I would be a completely different person. The way I’ve grown up has shown me that I shouldn’t chase money, but instead follow my interests and make lasting relationships. I’ve pretty much raised myself since about 6th grade. That’s when my sister started really acting out. I’d go home and go straight to my computer, just to escape my family. Every night all id hear is yelling for hours. Not once was I asked how I was doing, but to be fair I thought it was normal and thought I was okay. I started to realize as the years went on that a normal family talks to each other, and has dinner with each other every night. Now I know I’m not normal I guess. I knew there were kids going through much worse things than me so the only option I saw was to keep to myself, do my schoolwork (didn’t happen a lot), and don’t cause problems. My sister showed such anger and sadness that somehow I figured I shouldn’t show emotion. I could see what it was doing to my parents and it wasn’t right. With the lack of a caring mom, I needed to fill that void. So I started dating a lot of girls. I eventually got into a relationship with a girl that came from a family that didn’t have a lot of money. Her family was very close, and very supporting and caring to me. I really enjoyed her family, maybe more than I enjoyed mine. But me and her had a very toxic relationship, we argued every goddamn day and I thought to myself “this is normal. She’s just a girl this is what girls do.” I got so fed up with her that I broke up with her at the homecoming dance sophomore year in high school. I found myself wanting to still talk to her but I quickly realized it was just because I loved her family. I didn’t love her. We dated for about a year and a half. Then I found another girl and I honestly thought she was the one. We didn’t argue very often until towards the end of our relationship, and we really did enjoy our time spent together. Then I started smoking weed, she never liked that. I liked smoking because it took me away from all of my problems and made me feel happy. I started smoking nearly every day, most of the time behind her back. She found out and broke up with me. This breakup was the most heartbreak I have ever felt in my life. I really loved her. I started messing around with other girls shortly after we broke up and all it did was complicate. My sisters wedding was coming up and this girl that just broke up with me told me she was gonna surprise me and go to the wedding with me, and now she’s not. When I went to LA for the wedding, me and my mom stayed in a nice hotel. My parents were divorced at this point. The first night in the hotel, my mom went out and I was by myself. I searched my moms bag and found a shit ton of pills and started researching which ones I could use recreationally. I ended up taking 110mg of Valium. I overdosed and almost died. I threw up all day the next day, if I didn’t I don’t think I would be writing this right now. My mom took me to the hospital and I had to confess that I had taken the pills. I was sent to a psych hospital for 3 days and missed my sisters wedding because of it. The psych hospital was kind of refreshing to be honest, it felt kind of nice to be around people like me. Depressed, suicidal people. I socialized and met a beautiful girl there. We hung out until I had to leave, I gave her my phone number and Snapchat not knowing if she even liked me. I left the hospital and went home, I didn’t hear from her for about a month. Then I got a call from California, and it was her. We talked on the phone every day for a couple weeks. She said she missed me. I wanted more than anything to go see her again, the only reason I got out of bed was because of her. I realize now that that was a really unhealthy way to handle that situation. I eventually stopped getting calls from her and wondered what happened. A month or two after the calls stopped, she added me on Snapchat. I told her I wanted to come see her but the plane tickets were too expensive for me right now. She replied “lol”. I didn’t respond. I feel like a complete idiot for thinking she was into me. And now I feel like my heart is frozen. I don’t know if it’s possible for me to love another girl as much as I loved the one that broke up with me before the wedding. I feel like a shitty person. I feel like everybody at my school hates me. I don’t go to class very often because what’s the point? I don’t see a bright future for myself. I think about ending my life a lot. All it would take is some pills. But what if I do make it someday? What if I could help people? Is it worth finding out? I feel like there’s nothing left for me. I feel like if I ended my life, it would be okay. I think maybe I need help but how the fuck do you help someone like me? The psych hospital was kind of helpful but now I’m back to feeling shitty and in some ways I’m worse than I was before. I don’t even really know how to explain my pain. Maybe it’s a lack of love. Maybe my parents did a shitty job raising me. I see a lot of kids my age being happy and content with life. In some ways I wish I could be them, but then who would be me? Maybe my unique background calls for a unique future. Maybe the ordinary happy Mormon kids will have an ordinary future. Fuck the happy Mormon kids. How the fuck do they do it? Be so happy all the time? I don’t even know what I need for myself to be happy. I feel like I need another meaningful relationship, and I feel like I want a family that I can be happy with, but will that even make me happy? Or will I end up disappointing my kids with a shitty life? Is it possible to have a happy normal childhood? If it means being a happy normal person then I don’t want it. I don’t think I would change anything about my life because I don’t even know what I want. I thought a relationship would make me happy but even then in my past relationships, I wasn’t really happy. Do I just have to live with the fact that I’ll never be happy? How the fuck do I do that? If I didn’t have my best friend in my life I think I would already be dead. He’s helped me through nearly everything. Recently we’ve been spending a lot more time together, and i like it. It’s nice to have someone you can count on to always be there for you. Maybe that’s all I need in life. But what happens if I lose that? I don’t have many other friends. Maybe I need to keep searching for my purpose until I’m satisfied. Why is life so hard and so complicated? Why can’t I just be happy with the life I have right now? I can’t seem to let go of my demons. Fuck it, I guess I’ll go play some video games, smoke some weed, eat a kit kat, and see where life takes me.",excited,Happiness

- I text my family every day and various friends in order to maintain social relationships.    
- I talk to coworkers and strangers as much as possible, as a study showed that extroverted behaviour makes people happier.    
- I have a gratitude practice I do 3 times a day, in the shower when I wake up I think of things I’m grateful for, have an app that I write 3 good things into after work, then write in a gratitude journal before bed.     
- I try to exercise 3x a week.   
- I use a therapy app 7cups to talk about anything negatively affecting me.   
- I listen to music often as it seems to have a positive effect on mood regulation.

Things I am trying to work on:  
- incorporating dance into my life, maybe to dance for at least five minutes a day, as dancing has been shown to increase well-being and release endorphins.    
- watch something funny every day, as humor makes people happier.

"Happiness Revisited: did early retirement have an impact? Three years ago, I started [tracking my happiness](https://accidentallyretired.com/enjoying-life/how-to-track-your-happiness/170) using Jim Collins’ system that he devised and spoke about on The Tim Ferriss Show.

Last year, after a request from a reader, I launched the [Happiness Tracker Spreadsheet](https://accidentallyretired.com/resources/happiness-tracker-spreadsheet/502), so that you too can **track your happiness**.

But there’s no point in tracking anything, *if you aren’t going to review and make changes*.

It’s been awhile since I’ve updated and analyzed my overall happiness. *So…did early retirement have an impact?*

### Happiness in early retirement

I’m still a parent.

I’m still a spouse.

It’s not always rainbows and unicorns.

If there is one large lesson I have learned in the last year, it is that though my happiness has continued to improve, *I still have to choose to do the things to make me happy*.

"5 Ways Hot Tea Can Benefit Your Health  The benefits of tea have been studied for many years and some believe that it is a key to good health. For starters, it is a great alternative to coffee as it has less caffeine and usually requires a reduced amount of added sugar. Here are some additional health benefits from drinking hot tea.

“The natural compounds in tea may help with heart disease, diabetes, and cancer and it supports weight loss,” says Rachel Lander-Canseco, PIH Health clinical dietitian. “Drinking at least one cup of tea a day can enhance the tactics we are already implementing to improve our health.”

1. **Improved eye health.** The antioxidants in green and white tea can help prevent serious eye diseases like cataracts and glaucoma. You may see an improvement in your eye health by sipping hot tea.
2. **Lowered risk of stroke.** The chemical compounds found in black and green tea help support the vascular system. Researchers have found that drinking tea at least three times a day can lower your risk of a stroke by 21 percent.
3. **Better digestion.** Tea is a good natural remedy to [improve digestive health](https://www.pihhealth.org/wellness/blog/ways-to-boost-your-digestive-health/) and can help alleviate other digestive symptoms. The tannin in tea acts as a digestive acid and is an effective treatment for indigestion, gas and constipation. For more information on digestive tests and treatments, visit [Digestive Health Services](https://www.pihhealth.org/services/digestive-health/).
4. **Sharpens your memory.** [Studies](https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/info-2017/drinking-tea-may-reduce-dementia-risk-fd.html) have shown that green and black tea may boost cognitive functioning. Drinking hot tea regularly can help strengthen your memory and keep it in tip-top shape.
5. **Controls stress and anxiety.** Hot tea naturally has calming effects that curb stress and anxiety. Sit down and relax while enjoying a hot cup of tea and discover its stress-reducing benefits.

Bundle up this winter with a hot cup of tea. Whether you’re looking for a drink to calm a sore throat, or looking for a bit of caffeine to start your day, tea can be a great new component to incorporate into your daily diet....[continue](https://kusherlandholistichealing.shop/5-ways-hot-tea-can-benefit-your-health/)",excited,Happiness
"Will moving make me happy? I grew up in Appalachia and moved to Houston TX after I graduated college. I've been in Houston now for 6 years and I'm miserable. I hate the city life and want to move back to the mountains. In my field (oil industry) if I left my job in Houston I'd be taking at least a 50% pay cut by getting a job somewhere in TN, KY, WV. I get 2 weeks of vacation a year and every year I go back to Appalachia (to go hiking and camping), and every other year I visit my family (only seen family 3x in past 6 years). 

If I quit my job and move, will I be happier? I'll get to hike every weekend and go camping when I want and I'll be able to drive to see my family on weekends or if there is an emergency. I feel like life is too short to only do what I love for 2 weeks a year on my vacation. 

However, I'd be taking a massive pay cut and giving up on what I could become professionally. I'm a high performer in my career and it's not unrealistic that I could be making over 400k/year in 10 years if I stay. If I leave and get a new job, the max I'll make in 10 years will be 100k/year.

But what if I move and take the lower paying job and the mountains don't make me happy? What if I've been in the city too long and I've lost my roots?

I'm looking for advice from someone who grew up in the  mountains and spent their whole career in a city, or someone who left their career in the city to be back in the mountains. Was it worth it? If you could go back would you do something different?

"Can someone be unemployed and happy? Is it a case that lack of work (the 9 to 5, interaction ...) makes us unhappier or the insecurity that comes from the lack of work causes unhappiness. 

I'm interested in something beyond the commonsense that, sure, between the jobless and those with a stable job the ones with a job are happier. 

Let's think of it this way: say the unemployed get enough money not to worry about food and the bills. The employed earn more money (of course) and *have all the ""other benefits""*

Can the unemployed be happy, scientifically speaking, or do those *""other benefits""* (beyond the paycheck) make the difference?

I'd like to help support as many others along this journey as a little kindness after all the lock downs and quarantines as i'm sure some people could use it.

To join in you'll need to set aside around an hour each week for the lessons, and then you can maximize what you learn by having a chat about it afterwards via video conference with other r/happiness members, or in a chat thread in a forum i've set up. 

There's no money involved at all, unless you decide to pay the university to sit the exams, which will look excellent on resume's and CVs.

"Is happiness relative? Just to clarify what I mean with this question

So imagine you are born in a huge dome along with thousands of others. No one in this dome knows anything exists outside of the dome. There's basic food, basic housing, basic entertainment, just basic everything but everyone is contempt with it and all basic human necessities are met.

Now imagine the dome breaks and everyone discovers life outside of the dome. They discover amazing food, amazing housing, amazing entertainment, everything they had but more amazing but they cant leave. I believe they will be much more unhappy from this discovery even though they still have the same resources they always have.

Have you ever thrown a pebble into the still waters of a pond? Little ripples spread from that point where the pebble hits the water, creating a circle that keeps on expanding. The same thing happens when people do small acts of kindness. Researchers in Spain proved the theory with the help of a little trickery.

Workers at the Coca Cola bottling plant in Madrid were asked to participate in a ‘happiness study’. The volunteers were asked to keep notes of their mood and any special acts of generosity they performed. Then the researchers secretly planted 19 volunteers in the group and told them to do special acts of kindness for 1/2 the group (not for the other half). They wrote thank you notes, offered to get drinks, and other small acts of kindness. (I can picture those researchers chuckling as they came up with their secret plan of trickery!)

I’m writing now because I feel like it can not get better anymore. I don’t know why but it feels like nothing matters my grades, future, religion, family. It feels like everyone around me are just sad and hate what they do yet they live like if everything is okey. I want to ask for help but it feels like no one care. Every time I think that I can’t do it anymore I think about the great robin Williams may he rest i peace.

I don’t feel welcomed with friends nor with family and I have to laugh with people I truly hate the way they choose to live.

"I used to be suicidal, my steps out of it Early this year, I was very suicidal. I had gone through a break-up before, was working a go-nowhere job, gained a lot of weight, and felt disconnected and isolated from everything. The best part of my day was going home and looking at suicide forums trying to figure out the best way to do it. I felt no hope for humanity, no love for anything, I felt my entire existence was purely selfish. 

There were little things that pulled me out of this mentality. I realized that if I were to remain alive, I needed to try my best to live happier, I needed to get out of the hole I was in. I started reading a lot about Buddhism and happiness, trying to figure out exactly what I was missing and why I was so unhappy. I got put in the right direction by the Dalai Lama when he said that hate/negativity take away from a happy state of mind. I got out of echo chambers which were toxic and wanted me to fall into misery. I stopped going on 4Chan and stopped any fascination with alt-right politics and incel ideology which had gotten me into a hateful spiral.

I started to get more into daily gratitude, and trying to improve my gratitude for the things that I did have in my life. About 6 months ago I decided to really focus on improving my health and losing weight, I didn't want to be winded going up stairs anymore. I started spending more time with friends and family instead of isolating myself. 

A little bit later I started amping up being social even more, contacting cousins and acquaintances to see how they were doing, talking more with coworkers and trying to be social. I left a delivery job where I didn't talk to people all day, and decided on going into work that has me around people more. 

Nowadays I have a 3-6 people that I text as much as I can, basically whenever they get back to me. I try to hang out every weekend with my cousin and mom and dad and friends. I basically don't give myself time to be alone, I think naturally human beings are not designed for being alone, we do best with other people. Times of quiet reflection are good, but mostly we should be around others as much as possible in order to lift our mood. 

I also think that, although I am still selfish in many ways, I've accepted some of the paradoxes of human life. Yes, I eat meat and probably pollute in many ways, and I am fixated on career and personal relationship goals which are selfish, but I try to give back to the world. I give to charity, even though I don't have much money, and try to brighten other people's days and give back. 

I think of all those people who post on /r/suicidewatch or /r/depression and how bad they feel, as well as places like /r/nihilism, where people just feel hopeless. I recognize that I can't turn the tide and fix the world's problems, I'm only one man, I can only do what I can. I try to give back and help others, and it gives me meaning and purpose, but I also realize that I can't lose myself in that space of negativity and sadness.",excited,Happiness
"Adopting the positive psychology emphasis on socializing/relationships has improved my life I've been reading a lot of positive psychology the last few months and have been doing the best that I can to integrate it's findings into my life in order to be happier. Especially since I've had a history of mental health issues and depression, I really thought I would work to try to have a more positive approach to life.

One big thing I implemented is trying to connect much more with others. I've ended up putting more effort into some of my personal relationships with my friends and family, and would say I have 5 people in my life I really love and trust. Instead of isolating myself I've done more to talk with them and open up to them and appreciate what they do for me, as well as having gratitude for the role they play in my life. I've recognized that no man is an island, and that my life without others is mostly meaningless, it's connecting with others that gives that sense of purpose and happiness to life. 

Looking back on the past I can see that a lot of my struggles were because I isolated myself too much, I would spend my weekends holed up in my room by myself instead of talking with the people around me. I think this is the source of a lot of loneliness and depression nowadays.",excited,Happiness
"Want to share your story about happiness with an NPR show? Hi! On Point (a public radio show broadcast on hundreds of NPR stations across the country) is doing a show about happiness next Tuesday. We’re talking to Dr. Laurie Santos, a psychology professor of one of Yale’s most popular classes--the science of well being.

We want to know:

With everything going on in the world, have you struggled to achieve happiness lately?

What are the things holding you back from being happy?

Have you felt that you don’t deserve to be happy?

What have you found that has made you truly happy over the past year or so?

If you'd like to share your story, please leave us a voicemail at 617 - 353 - 0683. We may play it on air.

"What are you feeling right now? You are always catch what you are fishing for.  To see what you were fishing for just look at what you have.  Sometimes when the water is cloudy and you cannot see to the bottom just cast out your bait. Wait for a bite and reel in. What do you have? When whatever it is breaks through the surface of the water and you can see it you now know what you were fishing for.  If you want something else just change your bait or the type of hook you are using.

Reality is a mirror of you.  Your point of view determines your bait and what you catch. What if for a moment you allowed yourself the luxury of feeling wonderful, light hearted and filled with a general enthusiasm for this moment?  What would you be feeling right now?  Happy, light, airy, smiling or perhaps taking a slow deep breath?  Or are you too busy or skeptical to be caught by this nice sounding bait?  Go ahead right now and imagine a moment of peace and calm and then become aware that you already have it.

When you look in a mirror you see a reflection of light that is your self.  How deeply do you see into this reflection?  On the surface there are the shapes, colors and forms of the outside of skin, hair and clothing.  Perhaps makeup, jewelry and a costume.   Actually our facial expression and body language and that smile you give yourself, that last look and the feeling that goes with it is carried out into your day. 

Filled with intention, excitement, adventure, anxiety, fear or dread you proceed outward.  Casting out your bait the mirror of your life precedes every step.  You did this yesterday and you will do it again tomorrow.  It is as if you are practicing to get it right but by doing the same thing over and over it will never change.  Maybe you are practicing the wrong thing.

Change your bait to being happy.  Cast it out and reel in. If you have caught something else throw it back.  Don’t even bring it on your boat.  Or use a thinner lighter fishing line.  One that will break if the catch is too heavy.  Leave the worries and should haves out in the water.  As you continue to fish with lighter and lighter line your catches will keep getting smaller and smaller until they are so small you cannot see them and you can just fish with no bait at all and just enjoy being.

What if for a moment you allowed yourself the luxury of feeling wonderful, light hearted and filled with a general enthusiasm for this moment?  What would you be feeling right now? ",excited,Happiness
"Profound insight is only possible through a calm mind - what David Lynch calls ""catching the big fish"" We all have big questions that we’re looking for answers to - who am I? Where am I going? Who left the milk out on the counter? If the answers were easy we wouldn’t need help - sometimes talking it through with other people can help us to gain insight, other times the advice we get isn’t so useful for us. How come we don’t just know what to do?

Lots of things get in the way of finding answers. Being so close to something you lose perspective on it is common - thats where the phrase ‘cant see the wood for the trees’ comes from. We need to be able to step back, ideally step waaaayy back to understand not just what the answer is, but if the question is important.

Where do the answers come from? Its critical to remember that insight comes from a calm mind, so daily practice is essential. If you’re struggling with something that you need answers to regular meditation is gamechanging - if not life changing! - so get into a regular routine, ideally 15-20 minutes each morning. What you’ll find is that the more you practice, the more easily to can settle into a state of calm awareness. Some days your mind will be busy and that's OK. But as you become calmer and more present, you’ll find when you’re meditating that your unconscious starts to make connections and answers will begin to pop up during and after.

I find that meditating is when many creative ideas and insights arise and this isn’t uncommon. The film director David Lynch talks about ‘catching the big fish’ - by which he means tapping into an ocean of creativity and insight through mindful awareness that exists within every human being. You can access that too, and if you find these thoughts starting to arise during meditation, you might want to keep a pen and paper beside you so you can note them down afterwards.

The other critical enabler of finding answers to our questions is the concept of emptiness. In the West our idea of emptiness is loneliness, lack of fulfilment in our lives. But in mindfulness emptiness is referring to letting go of our illusions of how the world works, like the idea of a separate self. Instead we can be filled with the present moment, joy, awareness, experience, perceptions. By letting go of our beliefs and accepting the world in front of us, we open ourselves up massively. Suddenly the interconnections reveal themselves and we begin to gain insight into ourselves, our lives and our world.

"Give once/month or fractional amount once/week? Hi all, I'm budgeting $100 per month to give to a charity I support. Must be done online.

"Smiling (even when it is fake) We smile when we are happy, but we also become happy when we smile. This phenomenon is known as facial feedback. A 2019 meta-analysis \[1\] of 138 studies verified its moderate but significant impact on happiness. Even fake smiling activates pathways in your brain that put you in an emotionally happy state \[2\].

Knowing this I have tried to smile more, but never really got consistent with it. Sitting all day in front of a screen didn't give me much reason to smile either. That is why I built a mobile app that reminds me to smile and checks my face if I really smile. I believe it helps me and hopefully others as well. 

I am aware that this could be considered a marketing post, so please just remove it if it is not ok.

"We call upon Reddit to take action against the rampant Coronavirus misinformation on their website. Everyone on this planet has been affected by the SARS-Cov-2/Coronavirus/Covid-19 pandemic. You may have been in lockdown, you may have been forced to work under some form of duress, you may have lost a loved one to the disease, you may be left with long term side effects of the illness, you may have found that regular food, housing, and/or medical care is less attainable or more expensive now.

We could have been better off months ago, but disinformation and lies have been allowed to spread readily through inaction and malice, and have dragged this on at the cost of lives. There are those who deny that the pandemic even exists, there are those who think that wearing a mask will literally suffocate you, there are those who think it's no worse than a regular flu virus, that it's a bioweapon, and everything in between. This volume of blatant misinformation is problematic and dangerous.

It is clear that even after promising to tackle the problem of misinformation on this site, nothing of substance has been done aside from quarantining a medium sized subreddit, which barely reduces traffic and does little to stop misinformation.

 

The disinformation and false information is manifold. There is no area of recognised safety procedures when it comes to battling the spread of a dangerous virus that is not under attack here. All empirically proven measures which can help save lives are under attack. Masks work1 , but not according to the propaganda. The vaccine is safe,2 it is not untested, and it is not experimental technology or DNA manipulation, but people getting their information from these propaganda subreddits are told the opposite. Social distancing is valuable3 , but people are being persuaded to not even do that. Cynical plays on emotion are made. Trying to keep children safe is painted as ""child abuse"". Lies are repeated so frequently that misinformed people begin to believe them wholeheartedly, trusting that they can't be incorrect because they're surrounded by people who believe it also.

There needs to be a more active involvement in preventing the spread of the disinformation that is keeping us within a pandemic that at this point is entirely manageable. The main problem with a concerted disinformation campaign is that such a message attains an air of legitimacy through sheer volume of repetition. This is dangerous when it comes to unsafe medical advice such as promoting the ingestion or injection of cattle dewormers, a known side effect of which is sudden death4 , or such as trying to convince people that a tested, FDA approved vaccine will cause death. There is a good chance that the disinformation that reddit is currently inundated with will necessitate people a stay at the toxicology department in the hospital or even cost them their lives. There can be no room for leniency when people are dying as a result of misinformation on this platform. Reddit as a global platform needs to take responsibility here.

 

We are calling on the admins to take ownership of their website, and remove dangerous medical disinformation that is endangering lives and contributing to the existence of this ongoing pandemic.

Subreddits which exist solely to spread medical disinformation and undermine efforts to combat the global pandemic should be banned.

"Need help on having more fun Lately, everything's been starting to get boring or shitty. The music that I loved to listen to and listened to everyday has become boring, the memes that I used to watch/read have become very unfunny, the conversations I have with people around me all seem uninteresting, the movies/series that I used to rewatch have all become so uninteresting, every single video I watch on YouTube are uninteresting, the books and comic books that I read are all uninteresting. There's also some family problems that really help me get uninterested in everything even more. Ever since Covid became a thing, I haven't gotten out of my house once(I'm excluding the shopping that I do), and I probably won't, so don't tell me to go out more often. I just need a way to have fun at home, something to do, something that'll make me happy, something that I'm interested in, please, help me. All the things that I used to love doing are now all boring. Pretty much the only thing that keeps me entertained and makes me kinda happy is drawing. Help!",excited,Happiness

I meditate and exercise regularly, do psychoanalytic therapy, journal and practice mindfulness. 

My understanding of Buddhist teachings make me think that my dissatisfactions lie in my inability to stay in the present as I'm always dreaming of future endeavours.

I beat myself up about having literally every possible privilege in life and yet being dissatisfied. I'm not ignorant about how difficult life is for many people. 

Am I having the typical existential crises? 
Am I struggling to grow up and take on social responsibility due to my attachment to instant gratification, physical appearance, wealth and freedom; avoiding difficulty and growth? And am I just struggling to accept life as it is? 
What should I do to answer these questions?

There's probably no straight forward answer to my questions but I'd like to hear from anyone who's had similar experiences and have some insight or advice to share!",excited,Happiness

Simple way to tell right here...   Bottom line, does your happiness level increase/decrease when people approves/disapproves of your actions involved with your passion?   

If you could care less what people think of you while you're immersed in your passion, and it totally makes you happy...then guess what? You've found it.  

But here's the other side to that...  If you love to play the piano for instance, but your best friend thinks it's silly to spend so much time doing it...and you let that effect how much time you devote to practicing... then you aren't as passionate about the piano as you thought you were.    

You are more concerned about what your friends thinks about you, rather than playing to satisfy your own desires.  

Motivation today to encourage you to find your true passion in this life.

"Being in nature reduces stress and blood pressure - but crucially also stops us ruminating on the past and future Spending time in nature makes a huge difference to our mental health; research has shown it can decrease our stress levels, reduce our heart rate and reduce our blood pressure - but one of the most interesting effects it has is to reduce how much we ruminate, how much we attach ourselves to our thoughts.

When we get swept away by our thoughts and lose touch with the present moment, suffering isn’t far behind. Being lost in the past and future drives a great deal of our sadness and anxiety. Where nature is incredibly powerful is in its ability to focus our attention, taking us out of our heads and into our surroundings via our senses.

And aside from all that, it takes us away from the information bombardment for a little while, away from our work and our phone and the TV. So when we give our full attention to a bird that's landed on a tree or take the time to look at the different parts of a flower we’re giving a minds a break and bringing ourselves back to the only place we can be happy - here and now.

But I'm now old enough that those trials are well behind me, and my life now is...it's so much simpler than any previous time in my life, and I've achieved hard won stability that I've never had before. I feel SAFE - safe from hunger, homelessness, isolation and loneliness. Through a lot of work and good decisions (after a lifetime of bad decisions), I can report I feel loved, safe, and healthy. I've *never* felt happiness like this my entire life! I call it bliss, but I think it's just how normal ppl live most of their lives lol. 

Anyway, every day I send up gratitude to the universe. And everyday nothing terrible happens. 

But, I fear things out of my control will happen. And not, regular things like anyone goes through. Tragic, irreversible things like people I love dying unexpectedly.

"Self-Discipline & The Mechanics Of Happiness You’ll find happiness and meaning in challenging yourself, testing your limits, overcoming obstacles, disciplining your impulses, making experiences of success and failure... simply by just living a full life and not being afraid of everything. That’s the short answer.

Dissatisfaction is a state of the mind. So you need to control your mind and not let the outside world dictate your thoughts for you. And what’s the benefit of controlling your mind and emotions? The process of self-control develops the capacity of the mind, the intellect. The mind develops under the influence of feelings and emotions and the ultimate goal is to increase the intellectual capacity. Only in this way you can see things clearly and unfiltered as far as possible. Our emotions can often blind us if we’re not careful and mentally vigilant enough. Our flaws can often stand in our own way. It is usually hard to realize this because it requires total self-honesty. So the path to happiness is emotional moderation, mental discipline, intellectual curiosity, and personal values to strive after in daily life.

In a way you'll achieve happiness when you stop chasing it. Don't question yourself or your own gained insights all the time. Don't overthink. Focus on the here and now, identify your duties in life, strive to fulfil them and remain loyal to your values and established goals. That will bring you inner satisfaction in the long term which will lead to sublime, gentle and sustainable happiness.

"Gratitude journaling can improve your mental and physical health. Here are some examples of things gratitude journalling can benefit: 1. Life Satisfaction and Ambition - There is research that supports the idea that practicing gratitude leads to greater self-improvement and motivation. Researchers found that students who practiced gratitude felt more inspired to elicit change in their lives, had higher life satisfaction, felt more connected and beholden to their interpersonal relationships.
2. Depression - Gratitude may lessen feelings of depression. A study showed that participants who wrote daily in a gratitude journal had fewer symptoms and feelings of depression in comparison to the control condition after 4 weeks.
3. Blood Pressure - In one study, women who wrote about 3 people or things they were grateful for, every day for 2 weeks showed mean reductions in their systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate.
4. Diet - Research shows that practicing gratitude may indirectly improve dietary choices by decreasing negative emotions.
5. Workplace Creativity - Research demonstrates that practicing gratitude for a mere 5 minutes can help create a more diverse and constructive workplace as well as improve creativity among teams.

"Give yourself permission to fail - its not failure that causes suffering, it’s how you view it A lot of the time we’re not fully aware of our fear of failure and how it influences our choices. We can feel paralysed, overwhelmed and unable to make new choices. This can lead to self criticism and depression.

What drives our fear of failure? We can get overly attached to the outcome of what we’re working on. Taking meditation as an example, many people don't start meditation because their mind is too busy or they couldn’t focus for a period of time. In other words, what if I try and fail? But in meditation its helpful not to get attached to achieving a particular state, we simply enjoy the experience of sitting and breathing for what it is, and the same principle can be applied to anything else. 

So when we start a new project, rather than imagining everything we have to do to get to the end, once we’ve made a quick plan we can focus on what we’re doing in the present moment. Lets say we’re doing a couch to 5k - we don’t have to wonder when we’re struggling whether we'll ever be able to complete 5k. We can start off by enjoying a brisk walk and the feeling of walking. We can then enjoy the feeling of a very slow jog, enjoying our breath, the feeling of our feet on our ground. You don’t have to be great at it - the idea of being great is a huge barrier to starting anything. Just experience and enjoy the feeling of being outside and exercising.

We can also take a step back and notice the thoughts and feelings we’re having when we struggle a little. We can acknowledge our fear of failure, our fear of judgement, our fear of embarrassment and give ourselves permission to feel anxious. We can welcome back our old friend fear, let him sit next to us for a while, make him a cup of tea, listen for a while and watch as he leaves, as he always does. Then we return - not to the outcome in the future, not to some masterplan but to when and where you are now. The meditation, the run, the project.

And at some point we will fail at something and that’s OK. Everyone fails, the only way you can avoid failure is by never doing anything. When we fail its an opportunity for us to learn, grow and live a happier life. We don’t have to hide it or shut it out. It isn’t the failure that causes us suffering, it’s the shame that leads us to criticise ourselves. When we choose to smile to our failure, we can start to let go of the shame that we feel from failure and begin to see failure as something valuable in building a happy life for ourselves. As Thich Nhat Hanh says - no mud, no lotus.

Originally formulated by physician and psychologist Edward de Bono, the 6 hats of thinking concept has continued to be a prominent area of study for researchers such as Göçmen and Coşkun. The hats are all associated with creativity, although some more than others.

1. Yellow hat - The hat of optimism, it concentrates on the positive outcomes of a present situation. It is the logical and optimistic way to approach an issue. People who take on this style of thinking conceive a higher number of unique ideas by 29%.
2. White hat - The cold, hard facts hat, it focuses on unbiased and neutral information, facts, and data. It helps when discerning what information is available or needed for the situation.
3. Black hat - The pessimistic hat, it considers the potential consequences, weaknesses, and downfalls of a situation and helps individuals conceive more creative solutions.
4. Green hat - The creative hat, it focuses on solutions, alternatives and novel ideas. It is often described as the solution to the problems presented by the black hat. Those who employ green hat thinking present 32% more deep ideas and solutions,
5. Blue hat - The processing hat, it concentrates on organizing, planning, and decision making. It puts the green hat solutions into action, making it a very influential hat in terms of creativity.
6. Red hat - The emotional/feelings hat, it is comprised of emotions, impulses, and gut feelings. It is very resilient, and it honors the emotions that may be present.

"The Best Investment For Our Future Health and Happiness The best investment for your future is not financial, such as investing in index funds. Or physical, like doing yoga every day. Though both can help. A study of 724 men conducted by Harvard allowed this question to be studied. What is the best investment of time and energy now for our future health and happiness? It turns out to be relationships.

## The Study

The study tracked participants health and happiness over a 74 year period. **And the single best indicator of happiness and health in later life was the strength of individuals relationships**. Building and maintaining strong relationships will be better for your health than more money or prestige, most of the time.

When we try and discover the impacts of decisions on our future health, we often try to work backwards. We start with an older individual. Then use the fallible tool of memory to isolate decisions and trends from their life that led them to where they are now. The use of memory often results in errors because memory is fallible.

This study attempted to bypass this problem by tracking the people as they grew up. Recording decisions, health, happiness, and wealth year by year. It’s called the Harvard Study of Adult Development.

## The Harvard Study of Adult Development.

In 1938 the study began. It followed 724 men(the 1940’s weren’t great at gender equality) through their lives. The participants came from all parts of the societal strata, upper, middle, and lower class.

One group of boys were specifically selected as sophomores (year 10 here in Australia) from Harvard College. While another group of the boys were selected from Boston’s poorest neighbourhoods. The boys from these areas came from mostly disadvantaged backgrounds.

The study measured health, happiness, financial success, aspirations and dreams. They routinely checked in year after year. Sending out another questionnaire, sitting them down for yet another interview. Today most of the participants have passed away. But the study continues to track their children and grandchildren.

[Robert Waldinger, the current director of the study and fourth director in total presented a TED talk watched by millions on their findings.](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?language=en)

## The Findings

This study allowed the future consequences of many actions to be measured. Does more money make you happier? Do cholesterol levels in your mid 50’s have a correlation to health in later life?

Now, these answers are almost impossible to answer because of [correlation vs causation](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson#:~:text=To%20answer%20questions%20like%20this,the%20values%20of%20two%20variables.&text=Causation%20means%20that%20one%20event%20causes%20another%20event%20to%20occur.). But what this study has allowed researchers to do is find the best indicator of future health. And the best indicator found was the quality of individuals relationships. The people with better quality relationships were happier and healthier.

## The Power Of Relationships

Three of the most important findings from the study were:

## 1#: Social connections are good, loneliness kills

Social connections are really good for humans. We evolved as social animals in tribes. Therefore we need close and strong social connections. And the lack of connection or loneliness kills. When isolated, we suffer terribly. Investing in relationships are key. Participants who had strong social connections were happier and healthier.

## 2#: It's the quality of relationships that matters most

Deep trusting relationships were the best indicator of future health. Not the number of relationships. The men with the highest satisfaction in their relationships, not the most relationships, at 50 were the healthiest at 80.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

## 3#: Social connections protect our brain

People in strong relationships, who felt they could trust and rely on their spouses, families, and friends, experienced higher retention of memory and cognitive abilities. Loneliness and poor relationships either don't inhibit or potentially cause quicker memory loss.

## Why Is This Surprising To Most Of Us?

Most of us want more money. [We're often hard wired to chase wealth and status](https://thehappyorchardblog.com/the-score-cards-that-count-in-your-life/). It is rare to survey a millennial who would put strong caring relationships in their top goals for life.

## Good Relationships Aren't Sexy

Being rich and famous is glamorous. We think being able to buy whatever we want will make us healthy and happy. It turns out investing in the quality of our relationships is a much better way to secure future health and happiness.

But this is counter-intuitive. We get caught up in the rat race of life. In the busyness, careers, eating well and exercising, buying a bigger house. Relationships are often left by the wayside.

Working on relationships is not sexy or glamorous. It's plain old hard work, a slog. I find myself sometimes thinking about other things I should be doing instead when spending time on relationships. Coffees with friends or long chats with families(virtual or face to face) leave the dishes not done or the bathroom not clean.

It's also scary to reach out to strengthen relationships, to open the door for others. Inviting people for tea, making the first phone call or proposing the weekly catch up. We open up to rejection. To the door being slammed in our face.

Just know each instance I go out of my way to strengthen my relationships with my spouse, friends and families. I have felt better afterwards.

Sometimes it won't work out, and sometimes the dishes will be left dirty. But we now know that investing in our relationships is the single best way to impact our future health and happiness. So, turn TV time to family board game night. Plan a monthly date night, or reach out to that friend for a zoom catch up. You will feel better afterwards. And you are protecting your heart and mind in the process.",excited,Happiness
"There is no way to happiness - happiness is the way. Building a disciplined practice of mindful awareness isn't a quick fix but its the best bet for a sustainable, happy existence If you’ve ever been away from home for a while you’ll know what a great feeling it can be to return. Coming home either to your house, a family home or a friends home is a happy moment, the lights are on, there’s someone to welcome you, there might be fire in the hearth, they’ll ask how you are, how was your trip. You might take a moment to appreciate the journey being over and being able to relax. If the weather was blustery then you might be glad to be out of the storm and in shelter.

Arriving home in the present moment is very similar. When we stop what we’re doing for a moment, focus on our breath, notice whats going on in our body and in our minds, we can ask ourselves how we are - whether we’re feeling anxious, happy, just listening to that feeling, not judging ourselves for feeling that way. If things are a bit stormy for us right now, we can enjoy the shelter that taking a few breaths provides, available to us in every moment. We can enjoy our surroundings, taking a few breaths to notice where we are.

Thich Nhat Hanh gave us the words ""I have arrived, I am home, in the here and in the now."" We can use these words at any point during the day to stop, breath and arrive home in the present moment. This is called returning to the breath, and it’s a way to develop your practice from something that you do every so often at specific times into what Jon Kabat Zinn describes as a way of being. Similarly, Thich Nhat Hanh says there is no way to happiness - happiness is the way.

What does this actually mean? The good news is that we don’t have to wait to be happy. If we focus our awareness in the present and enjoy the world in front of us rather than long for the world we desire, we can let go of our suffering and experience peace and joy.

The more difficult part is that it requires patience, persistence and most of all practice. Mindfulness is all about the experience so working that discipline of awareness into your day, integrating it into everything you can really pays off. It’s not a quick fix or a silver bullet, but its much more effective at cultivating happiness than anything we could wish for.

"Get out for a regular walk in nature as part of your mental health routine - really paying attention to your surroundings makes a big difference to your wellbeing Most of the time walking is a means to get us from A to B and while we’re walking we’re thinking about the task that needs to be done once we get there. We're lost in plans and worries about the future, not noticing how we're feeling or our surroundings. By slowing down and paying attention we can extract joy from something that we do every day.

You can start by focusing internally - slowing down the pace to a couple of steps for your inbreath, a couple of steps for your outbreath. As you’re slowing down you can begin to notice the pressure of your feet on the ground. As you take each step you can feel the pressure begin at the heel of your foot and flow through the sole to toes, then lifting from the heel again. Really focusing on that feeling, noticing the connection with the ground. As you do this you can notice thoughts arrive and leave, not being swept away by those thoughts but smiling to them, accepting them and letting them go, returning our attention to the feeling of walking on the earth. You can feel some gratitude for your feet, being aware of how important they are for getting around. 

Then you can focus your awareness on your surroundings, starting with what you can hear - birdsong, a plane in the sky, the wind in the trees. You can stop for ten breaths and really focus your attention on one thing, for example a tree or a flower. Taking in its shape, size, colour, texture,  everything you can sense - taking some time to pay attention to the exclusion of everything else. After giving it some time, you can return to your walk until something else catches your eye.

When we walk mindfully, we don’t walk to arrive anywhere, we’ve already arrived in the present moment. We don’t even do a walking meditation to make ourselves calm or happy - having goals for meditation tends to get in the way. We walk simply to enjoy each step; to be present with walking, giving ourselves permission to let go of worries about the future and regrets from the past. That being said - there’s lots of evidence to show that walking in nature is very good for our wellbeing, even thinking about nature can relax us and lift our mood.

"Cloudy sunsets make the best sunsets – and other life advice &#x200B;

Ever since I got my first iPhone and realized the power of being able to snap a picture anywhere, anytime, I began to capture sunset pictures.

Sunsets force you to be *present in the moment* to enjoy something that *will only happen* in this particular way, with these exact colors, *only this one time*.

**Yet, the best sunsets are accompanied by clouds.**

As much as we always want life to be easy and clear, it often is muddled with cloudiness, murkiness, or times that are simply somewhere in the middle.

And similar to cloudy sunsets, some of the best memories come from the cloudy days *in your life*.

"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don’t like? If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

"Happiness is really simple Don't try to guess what will make you happy this year.

Don't set new resolutions. Conduct a detailed 2020 review instead. This 10-minute exercise changed my outlook for the coming year. 

Get a blank sheet of paper, draw a line down the middle to make two columns, name one positive, the other negative.

Flip your calendar to January 2020 and relive the year, week by week. As you do, jot down the good and bad in the appropriate columns. If you journal, flip through that as well.

After completing this exercise, I was dumbfounded by how a few simple variables constituted 90% of my well-being.

My best days: outdoor cardio, proper sleep, frequent reading and writing, frequent playtime (racketball, frisbee, deep conversations), cold showers, and active in-person socialization (family, friends and dating life).

With all of those variables in place, I felt happy, motivated, and grateful to be alive.

My worst days: stress & overwhelm, unnecessary busyness, poor sleep, canola oil, obsessive number checking (stocks, bitcoin, website traffic, podcast downloads), and unrestricted social media use.

Those weeks sucked.

From this basic exercise, I know what to prioritize this year and what to avoid. Use the past year's worth of data to derive your own personal happiness equation!

[Here’s a recipe](https://medium.com/@trekhleb/this-is-how-social-media-could-ruin-your-happiness-1fa4e6588900) for how you can ruin your happiness and start feeling miserable using social media:

1. Stop all attempts to figure out ***who you are***, ***what your purpose is*** and ***what your identity is***.
2. Start ***comparing yourself to others*** by scrolling social media feeds as often as possible and as much as possible.
3. While doing that start thinking that ***people have it all*** (while [they are not](https://qz.com/1274601/randi-zuckerbergs-advice-for-achieving-your-life-goals-pick-three/)).
4. Pay attention to their ***triumphs*** and ***victories*** only (they won’t show you their ***trials***, ***hardships*** and ***cost*** they paid anyway).

"Ideas of happiness can be the root of your sadness Your ideas of happiness can also be a reason for your bad habits / addictions. Maybe your ideas of happiness are the reason why you are not happy. Because when you have an idea of happiness you will only feel happy when the idea becomes reality. Without an idea of happiness you can see happiness in everything. So if you have a lot of ideas of happiness I would also recommend to write down all these ideas on a piece of paper. Now you have written down everything, let everything go. Again I would recommend meditation as a tool to let things go.

"Comparison is the thief of joy - don't miss out on your life worrying about what other people have Everyone compares themselves to others to some extent but when it plays on our thoughts frequently this can really impact on our wellbeing. The evidence on this has been around since the 1950s - people have always used their relative position against other people as a way of evaluating themselves. Its probably a natural part of the human experience, but problems arise when we’re constantly aware of what other people have and what we don’t have, leaving us dissatisfied with our lives.

The habits of being competitive and comparing ourselves may have built up over generations, so don’t beat yourself up for feeling this way. There isn’t a quick fix to it but there are a few things can help, the first being training your awareness. A little bit of practice every day makes a huge difference and we can use that training to be aware in the moment when that competitive energy is rising. In that moment, shining our awareness and giving that feeling our kindness while we breathe stops us from being swept away and breaks the link between feeling and acting.

The second way is to be grateful for what you have - keeping a log of three things every day of you’re grateful for is a great way to do this. These can be big things like your health, small things like your breakfast or neutral things like the feeling of your feet on the ground as you walk. Taking joy in the world around you is the formula for a happy life.

The last way is spending less time on the things that drive our competitive energy. That might be social media, certain TV programmes or it might be worth rethinking what you want from your career. If the alternative to eternally striving for success is a small, ordinary, happy life - whats wrong with that?

"If you lie awake worrying, the problem may not be what you're anxious about - you need to take better care of your mental health generally It’s easy to worry these days, it feels like we live in anxious times. There’s big things like health, work, school or money but there’s lots of little stresses that pop up like worrying someone might be annoyed at you or being late. The happiness and joy in our life can pass us by because our minds are stuck in the future, worrying about what might happen.

Fixating on worries can be a symptom of poor general wellbeing, so give yourself a mental health check up - your sleep pattern is key to this but it’s helpful to make a list of daily activities that help you to maintain your peace - meditation, exercise, yoga, creative activities, reading, socialising, going for a walk in nature - whatever wholesome activities suit you. Being aware of the things that disrupt your mental health is also important - caffeine used to drive my worrying but alcohol, TV, news and social media can also have an impact. 

The point is not to tell you what to do or what to consume. The point is that bringing awareness to what you consume allows you to monitor the effect that food, media and experiences have on you and enables you to make informed choices. Setting up a good mental health routine and sticking to it will make a huge difference with worrying.

The second part is being present with what you’re experiencing. When you have a worrying thought, notice it arising and sit with it for a moment, listen to it. When we see our difficult emotions as friends rather than enemies and tend to them with compassion we take away their power over us, they no longer can control our behaviours. We can breathe and allow the worrying thought to pass without acting on it, without being swept away by it. We can smile to our anxiety and smile to our difficulties.

The final way to tend to our worrying to to look deeply into it. Our reaction when worries are coming up is to barricade the door and try and shut it out but it’s an opportunity for us to find out why we react the way we do and find out where the root of our fear lies. Most of the time, our fear lies in deeply held assumptions or beliefs, created by experiences from the past. When we shine the light of compassion and awareness onto that assumption, we can ask ourselves whether it’s really true. Taking the time to explore with kindness the parts of ourselves that live in the dark is how we liberate ourselves from suffering.

Happiness is knowing you figured out a healthy way to change an unhealthy habit and its working.👍😊🧡 What have you done that made you happy lately?,excited,Happiness
"SUCCESS IS NOT HAPPINESS… HAPPINESS IS SUCCESS If Success was Happiness   
Then achievers would be glad   
But look around and you will find  
That many of them are sad

Of course, Achievement gives joy   
And excitement, oh boy!  
But when our need becomes our greed  
To misery, this will lead

The whole world is chasing Success   
Everyone wants achievement   
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose   
There is no Contentment

Why do people want to succeed?   
Why is everyone in a race?   
The Truth is that we want to win   
So that there is a smile on our face

But though we win, we are not glad   
We have money, why are we sad?   
Happiness is not money, the sages said   
It's sleeping soundly when you are in bed

We hear of suicides in the homes of the rich  
 If they were Happy, then why this glitch?   
Although they are achievers, this fact we know   
They are not Happy, their face has no glow

If successful, but unhappy, what is the use?   
Winning or smiling, what would you choose?   
The purpose of Success is for us to be glad   
What is the use of winning, if it makes us sad?

Happiness is something different, we learn  
Not just money that we earn and burn   
Happiness is built on a foundation of peace   
Then we are blissful like waves in the seas

Look around at the people who are glad   
They live in the moment, they are never sad   
They don't swing from the future to the past   
They are the one's whose Happiness lasts

Happiness has no price tag, know this my friend   
It's a state of mind where nothing can offend   
It's being able to smile, and able to laugh   
Not just trying to raise our Success graph

We can't measure joy in dollar and pound   
Happy is he who peace has found   
Though we may fly the world around   
We may be miserable on the ground

Success is not Happiness, this Truth we must know   
We may have everything, what's the use of this show?   
The truly successful one is he  
Who lives with smile, laughter, and glee

If one is Happy, then one has achieved all   
One doesn't have to be rich and in fame be tall   
One can have little, but if content is he   
Then he can live joyously

Achievement gives Happiness, this fact we know  
But with Fulfillment and Contentment, does Happiness grow   
One who is Happy, doesn't need to win  
He has Peace and Joy without committing sin

Joy doesn't need a foundation of cash  
One doesn't have to be rich, to enjoy life's bash   
Happiness is a simple state of the mind  
It comes from being loving, it comes from being Kind

Happiness is Success. It is achieving life's goal  
It is being Happy in the heart, Peaceful in the Soul   
True Happiness is eternal, not just a moment of joy   
It last's forever, it can’t be destroyed

Success is a journey of valleys and peaks  
Life is a see-saw, there are laughs and squeaks   
Success, unlike Happiness, doesn't last for long   
But the truly Happy ones always sing a Happy song

So, Success is not Happiness, Happiness is Success   
You may be an achiever, whose heart is not at rest   
But though not successful, if Happy you are   
Then you are an achiever, you are the very best",excited,Happiness
"I think I finally found my key to that elusive thing called happiness Everyone is different and everyone needs to find happiness their own way. I'm in my mid 30s and ever since I could remember, I've just always been a very pessimistic person. I mean, I remember being pretty young and just feeling hopelessness for no reason at all. I had no real reason to be that way, I just was. No matter what, no matter how much I told myself that my life was great, I would just sometimes feel really down or stress over things that didn't matter or didn't even happen yet. Even though I had amazing family and friends and everything I could possibly need or want, I would just keep feeling this hopeless feeling. Maybe I should have gone to therapy or something, but I was just always afraid that in the end their solution would just be to simply prescribe me pills, so I never talked to anyone professionally. Well this year something just made me say to myself - ""You're going to stop living like this, you're going to figure it out. You only live once!""
Don't get me wrong, despite feeling down and hopeless a lot, I have lived a pretty fun and happy life. I laugh A LOT and have amazing times with family and friends, so I'm not just sitting around doing nothing and being all sad all the time haha, definitely very far from that! But my head would always get to me when I was alone, I just always think way too much. I would find myself worrying about dumb things that hadn't even happened, like what if someone I love gets into a car accident and dies tomorrow?! What if next week I get some illness that causes me to go blind or lose my legs?! (My thoughts weren't always that extreme though haha, just sometimes)
So this year I started looking into different ways people find happiness. I watched webinars and read a lot of different stuff. At first I thought - this is stupid and none of this is going to work for me. But luckily I just kept with it, no matter how corny or ridiculous things sounded. For example, someone posted on here recently about how they'll just smile sometimes and it makes them feel better, even if they don't feel like smiling. Well I thought it wouldn't work for me, but I tried it a few times and hey guess what, it actually did make me feel better sometimes! Also just seeing others out there posting about their happiness (or lack of it) made me feel like I wasn't as crazy as I thought and that I also wasn't alone in how I felt. I realized that some people are just naturally super happy and some people are just not (no matter how great life is), and it's okay to be one way or the other. But what isn't okay is just letting yourself be worried and negative your whole life, that's just no way to live. So I tried a lot of different things like spending more time with nature, working on relationships, deep breathing to relax myself, improving my financial literacy (so that money is one less thing to worry about), etc. But I think the one thing that really helped me so far is just accepting that life is going to go however it goes, there's going to be some really good times and some really bad times, and I'll have control in some aspects but not in others. However the one thing I do have control over is my reaction. Bad times are inevitable, but why should I waste time worrying about them before they happen, or waste time feeling sorry for myself while they're happening?! So I've been working on telling myself to live for right now, be happy when you should be happy and be sad/angry/stressed/etc when you should be. I'll probably never be the kind of person that is just super happy all the time or the kind of person that can easily deal with bad times, but I definitely feel much stronger and happier simply because I feel like I finally found a logical way to think about this crazy thing we call life. I have a long way to go, but I feel I'm definitely on my right path.
I hope you all out there are able to find what helps you!

TLDR: I've always been negative and worried about way too much, but trying different techniques and gaining control of my reaction to bad times has helped me feel much stronger and happier in life in general!",excited,Happiness
"It's the little things :-) Just wanted to wish everyone a great day. I am always amazed by how valuable the little things in life are. Right now I am just sitting in a room with my 4, 6, and 8 year old waiting for them to go sleep, while I listen to some beautiful piano music on YouTube.",excited,Happiness
"Mondays are a great litmus for your life happiness Mondays are one of the most interesting days of the week, because people are most aware that they either really hate what they do, or wish they did something else. It is a very polarizing day. But as the week goes on, the feeling eventually subsides into indifference...until maybe Friday,, where we enter the weekend and have two days to undo the toxicity of the entire week (if we're lucky not doing chores and errands on Sunday).

Many of us have different reasons as to how we ended up in our current job/career situation, but that doesn't mean we need to be a prisoner to the decisions we made when we took this job or career. A college degree isn't supposed to be a life sentence, and family expectations aren't supposed to be nails in our coffin. Somewhere along the way, we believed someone else (who probably gave up on their own dreams) that we couldn't live a successful life and support ourselves and our families if we pursued that which we enjoyed; that we couldn't ""have our cake and eat it to."" Well what if we don't even fucking like cake?

One of the things we often hear people talking about lately is ""good energy"" and ""positive vibes."" A person that is miserable for most of their day, their week and by extension their life, is frequently doing things that make them unhappy. What we frequently do becomes our frequency, our vibe. Then, the only things we attract are people who are also justifying the miserable lives they live with cliches such as ""being an adult,"" ""a responsible individual"" or ""realistic.""  And we buy into it. 

But when we finally decide to change something, we tend to go back to the familiar instead of embracing the unknown career possibilities out there. This ""Monday feeling"" then becomes a negative stress that takes off years of our life. If we only do things that make us unhappy frequently, we will only connect with people who are also on that same frequency. And on the occasion that we do have a positive moment, it will fizzle out fast because our peace of mind and success are not intentionally created moments but random accidents. Don't let the most important things in our lives be up to chance.",excited,Happiness

Today can be your day. If you choose to, so keep going, keep pushing, we are going through some tough times but we can breakthrough and shine through. It takes work but it will be worth it, **I know it. Don't give up. Keep going. Keep pushing. It will all work out.**

**I love you.**

"I (22/f) met my boyfriend today after 4 months of being apart I met my boyfriend after 4 long months apart. It doesn't seem like much perhaps... But these months were extremely difficult for us because I'm just finishing the final piece of my undergraduate studies. It's been stressful with not much time to talk especially living in two different time zones.

We spent 4 hours in bed in each other's arms and i realised how much i missed his beautiful brown eyes. I think those 4 hours I was in a different dimension. It felt like a trance I didn't want to wake up from.

I know that this is the man i want to marry. And through so much, he's been there with me all along. 
And after many months, I felt genuinely at peace and so happy today...",excited,Happiness

I liked it but not only because of the program itself but because it made me reflect on my happiness. It is true that we focus on many things that indirectly make us happy, but many times we wonder why we are not entirely happy, if we need something to happen in our life, a new love, a new job, etc. but we never look for the answer in ourselves.

"Adulting’s Equilibrium It’s difficult being an adult. For me it’s the repetitiveness of it all. Day in day out. The same routines and chores every day. Makes me feel like i’m on a hamster wheel. It can be easy to resort to escapist behaviour that brings me the feeling of novelty. Especially in this “only a few clicks away” digital world.

Somehow we need to find novelty in the everyday. Look at what we’ve been doing (and what we have to do again) every day with a different set of eyes. Only then we can satisfy both needs. The need for progress in our lives, which comes through the compounding of repeated actions, and the need for novelty and excitement that our brain yearns for.

Good luck!",excited,Happiness
"When someone is abrupt with you, see it for what it is - a reflection of their circumstances Have you ever had a conversation, maybe with your co-worker or a friend, and they’ve been a bit abrupt? And you’ve thoughts afterwards, “what was that about? Are they annoyed at me?” We can get swept away by that anxiety or anger and not see what’s really going on.

You might go down one of two routes - get anxious that they’re upset with you and think of everything that that you might have done that they could have taken offense to, or maybe you get annoyed and you confront them, throwing a coin or two into the swear jar on the way out.

We can choose to take a step back and not get swept away by our immediate reaction notice the thoughts arising and listen to what they have to say. Then breathe and allow the thought to pass. Notice what feelings you have attached to them. You can sit with them for a few moments like you would if you were sitting with a friend.

Then we can become aware of what judgements we’re making. We might be judging our co-worker for being abrupt, we might think “what an asshole”, especially if we don’t know them well. We might be judging ourselves, thinking that we did something to set them off. Maybe we wish it hadn’t happened and try and shut it out of our minds, or maybe you obsess about the incident.

However, we can simply notice the behaviour and notice our reaction to it. Doing this will lead to what is almost certainly the right question: “what’s going on with them?” In all likelihood they may not even be aware of how they’re coming across to you. So you can give them a bit of space and then ask “hey, what’s going on with you?” They’ll probably be grateful for the opportunity to talk.

Of course some people will continue to be rude and abrupt, some people might be rude and abrupt with everyone all the time. Make sure your compassion and understanding isn’t reaching the point where your wellbeing is being harmed. Nothing is more important than your peace.

"depression and hopelessness to happiness with (six months of gratitude) - Day 183 Today is the 183rd Gratitude Bridge  


It's exactly six months since I started this project.  


It started with the intention of doing daily gratitude with the harbour bridge at sunrise.  


It started because on the 4th of August last year, I had a suicide attempt, and I had two more leading up to Christmas.  


And I had this last-ditch plan, that said why don't I try the idea of gratitude daily for 365 days, and I would video and document my journey.  


So here I am six months in, for the first 75 days I was able to maintain sunrises every day, that fell by the wayside, but the project never did.  


It's changed a little bit over time, but daily, I come down to the harbour bridge to do videography and talk about gratitude.  


today, I am grateful for six months of gratitude  


What are you grateful for?

"Look after your mental health by setting up a proper sleep/morning routine. Go to bed and get up at set times - even on the weekend Starting your day off well doesn’t involve a huge amount of rocket science but it does need a bit of patience and persistence. The key thing is setting up new habits and sticking to them every day, even on the weekend. The most important of these is your sleep hygiene.

The temptation is to use the weekend for a lie in, but if you’re like me and occasionally get insomnia the answer is to have a set time for going to bed and getting up. Getting into a rhythm in this way means that your body is ready for sleep at bedtime and is ready to rise in the morning. It’s also helpful to avoid the things that interfere with your sleep like alcohol and particularly caffeine - most of my insomnia (and anxiety) was caused by my coffee habit.

For the same reason its a good idea to keep mobiles and laptops out of the bedroom, they interfere with sleep and they also make it more difficult to get out of bed. Starting your morning with social media, which is designed to get a reaction from us, doesn’t set you up well for the day.

On to your morning routine - some activity as soon as as you get up is helpful. Whether you’re doing stretching, movement or yoga focus your awareness on your breath and what you can feel in your body rather than whats coming up in your day.

You can then sit for a guided meditation, morning is a great time to practice gratitude. Its the one trait that happy people have in common and its vital for cultivating our happiness, especially in the morning when our mind is in a suggestible state. 

Finally, you can practice mindful drinking and mindful eating with breakfast, paying all of your attention to each mouthful of food, being aware of the smell, texture and flavours, eating slowly and putting the spoon down between bites. Keeping in mind everything that went into it as you eat is another way to integrate gratitude into the start of your day.

It’s the evening.. it’s sunny and the weather is extremely mild.. not too hot.. a few rays are f the sun managed to slip inside and create a perfect lighting.. The roof of a church, parts of a massive  cedar tree and distant decorative trees with fiery autumn orange and yellow colors could also be seen from the window.. It’s also extremely quite and apart from the birds voice, I could hear the low humming of distant cars passing a few blocks away.. I can’t lie.. I felt really really happy.. it was a very brief moment when I realized that whatever problems I might have, the world is still rolling and birds are still chirping!!! I can now only remember that very recent but brief moment of happiness.. It happened less than 10 minutes ago.. This might sound weird and I felt like I just communicate that feeling to somebody!!",excited,Happiness

"Life Changes (168) Change is inevitable. Change will happen either way, if we want it or not. We as the human must be open to the change. The change is where we will find our true self, lose a part of our self that is no longer needed, what is needed though is the will to keep going.

Over the past year of my life, and all of our lives, change was forced onto us, we didn't choose to be where we are now, nor did we even know that it was going to happen, **we changed. Change happens if we want it or not.**

**I am proud of us. Some days may be difficult, but what am I learning is that the struggle comes from the eye of the beholder not from the actual situation itself. Watching rather than judging. Taking a step back when needed, instead of rushing in. Rushing in when we feel like we need to.**

Life changes & when it does, that is the Universe showing us that we are ready for that change, the sole thing **we have to do, is embrace it. Do so, life will get good after.**

"Zoom Out (93) We are so hyper focused. Focused on this moment, focused on this emotion, focused on what is right in front of us.

Its all about **perspective & mindset.**

We can constantly be so wrapped into everything that we are feeling which can be valid but sometimes it can enhance our anxiety, depression, pain, sadness and hinder our opportunity to grow. We are healing. We are healing right now, in this very moment and I want **YOU** to know that, if you don't realize it. It has happening **RIGHT NOW.** Remember, **GROWTH & HEALING** is radical, it isn't linear. Its all about 2 steps forward / 1 step back, 5 steps forwards / 3 steps back and so on.

Let me tell you, **PROUD OF YOU.** For trying again today, for pushing through the pain today, to embrace how you feel and to know that there is more to life than what is being felt right now. I know it can be hard, I know it can be exhausting, I know it can feel overwhelming and everything is too much, but **TRUST ME**, everyday that you are focusing, everyday that you're trying and making that 1 step or 1 action you are improving.

"All the small things: training yourself to be aware and grateful for the everyday little stuff puts you on the path of happiness In the Buddhist tradition, desire is seen as the root of all suffering - when we’re dissatisfied with our lives its because we’re attached to the idea that something better is out there that we don’t have. One of the reasons social media is bad for our mental health is because it feeds us a kind of highlight reel of other people’s lives and accomplishments, which increases our desire and unhappiness. We also get too used to normal, leaving us blind to the good things right in front of us.

So you might look at gratitude as being the antidote to that sense of dissatisfaction. We can be grateful for the important things like the people we love or our health, but it makes even more difference to take joy in the small things in our world . This might be sitting down in a comfortable chair, walking in the park or when you see a bird land in the garden. If you train your awareness regularly through meditation you can be more attuned to these small moments of happiness.

To really kick it up a notch and get the happy juices flowing, you can practice mindful gratitude for the normal, everyday, mundane stuff we usually don’t notice. Thich Nhat Hanh illustrates this with a toothache - if you’ve ever had one you know how painful it is and you’re aware of it all the time. You’d give anything just to go back to normal again, that feeling of not having a toothache. 

Once you go to the dentist and get it sorted out the relief is incredible and normal feels amazing - in mindfulness we call feeling that our non-toothache, the enjoyment and gratitude for simply being alive. We can feel this for our inbreath and outbreath, you can enjoy your posture, you can enjoy the feeling of your heart beating. When you get into the practice of enjoying the small things and the normal things, that’s walking the path of happiness. There is no path to happiness, happiness is the path.

"We're not always kind to ourselves - but you can let go of suffering by starting to look at yourself with fresh eyes, accepting what you see without judgement If you have kids/nieces/nephews you might have seen a baby suddenly become aware of their hand. They look at the palm, they look at the fingers, then they turn it over and realise there’s a back of the hand. And if they tell the fingers to move, it they wiggle! They laugh and laugh until the next experience comes along.  That’s what beginners mind is - approaching the world without assumptions, without judgement, without an idea in our heads for how things ought to be - just observing, accepting, feeling gratitude and joy. When we apply beginners mind to our loved ones, our environment and our work/studies we have a deeper appreciation for what we have and can live happier lives.

Its also helpful to apply beginners mind to ourselves, particularly if we have problems with self esteem - we sometimes judge ourselves harshly and are not kind when we look in the mirror. By focusing our awareness in our body, noticing what we're experiencing, accepting ourselves and practicing non-judgement we can learn to appreciate what we have and be kind to ourselves.A body scan is a great way to do this, and it has the added bonus of releasing tension and giving us a sense of peace.

Ever since quarantine started though, I feel like my happiness is very dependent on my boyfriend and his actions (i.e. him playing video games instead of messaging/calling me), but before I never used to care how long he'd spend cause I was busy doing my own stuff!

"The Secret to Happiness Some say happiness can never be achieved, that at the best we can seek happiness, This was one of many insights acknowledged  in the US Constitution. You always have the right to pursuit happiness, but in of itself, happiness belongs to no man. The secret to happiness is pain. Because we live in the world of the relative, the more pain you experience the easier it seems to be to find happiness, and contendness.  You have to have the bad, it HAS to be there. Imagine only having sugary things to eat your whole life. Would ice cream impress you that much?  No of course not. In light of these revelations and many others, i've come to the conclusion that \*\*Pain is the Key to Happiness\*\* at the very least experience is. it's hard to seperate the two sometimes.. Now of course more than a little pain will smolder any embers of happiness. But when you've had just the right amount of suffering, happiness will be found.",excited,Happiness
"Happiness can feel like it's outside our control - but you have more influence than you realise The four noble truths of the Buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness / suffering. The reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn’t an external factor that's outside of our control, it’s something that’s within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.

Which is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.

So how do we train ourselves to be happy? The first step is to focus on the positive.  This might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we’re more focused on where there might be wolves than where there’s flowers. This is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives. Social media is very focused on the negative because that’s what grabs our attention. Research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health. So we need to be careful what we consume.

We can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don’t have or what’s wrong. This takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative. I live in Britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it’s within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal. On the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them. This is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.

The second step is smiling to your difficulties. This sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult? There's two reasons - the first is neurological. When you smile, even if you don’;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you’re feeling. That's why we gently smile while we meditate.

The other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind. When we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we’re afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term. When we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, “there you are, my old friend”, we accept what we’re feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.

Count your Blessings. Say thank you for being allowed to wake up today, to start new; Give it your all and leave it ALL ON THE FIELD, its the only way.

**Take your time. Go Fast. Its Up to You.**

Everyday I make sure that I am doing a few things that are fun, getting outside, bike rides, playing video games, meditating. Its amazing the amount of energy that can come from meditating from Outside of Ourselves. It takes time, it takes practice and I am constantly practicing, everyday, every moment.

Its Our Turn. The year is about to switch over, but don't wait until it hits ""January 1"", to start your goals, ""resolutions"", **START THEM NOW.** Write a list down and start working towards 1, right now in this very moment. You can. Something that always helps me, is recognizing that if I do 1 thing towards my goal, passions, crafts, mental health; then I am progressing and thats all that matters. Moving Forward, Evolving, Progression. The Path is day to day, consistently, rather than one day here, one day there. Obviously you don't have to do EVERYTHING everyday and can take breaks in between days, but that will allow you to focus on other things in between those ""break days"".

"This is your life. No one else's That thing you’ve been putting off doing because you’re afraid of how it might turn out? I know you’re afraid you might fail. I know you’re afraid to be honest with yourself. I know you’re afraid to be that honest with your family and friends. I know you’re afraid of what other people might think of you but you know what?

F*ck them.

This is your life not theirs. You only get one shot to be happy. One shot to really live this life. One shot to be the person you were truly meant to be.

Stop thinking about it and psyching yourself out. I believe in you!

I promise you won’t fail if you just keep pushing. I’m not saying it won’t be difficult. All I’m saying is that you will get through it and you will be so much stronger because of it. Stop being so damned scared of yourself and choosing security over what you know in your heart is meant for you.

I mean, what’s the point of security if you live the rest of your life in fear and doubt? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of actually living your life? I’m talking REALLY living your life. Not the life your friends say you should have, or your parents say you should have, or society says you should have; but the life you know YOU know you were meant to live.

I know you're scared. I know you have doubts. I feel the same way sometimes. But if you want things to change then you have to stop thinking so much and just do! Your whole life has led you to this point and now it’s time to make a decision. Either you continue to live in fear of what might happen? Of what they might think of you? Of what if it doesn’t work?

Or

You take a chance on yourself. Step out on faith in yourself. Demand better for yourself! Be completely honest with yourself!

So what if they judge you! So what if they don’t understand or agree. So what if they talk about you. Guess what: you never had any control over that to begin with. People disagree with you, talk about you, and judge you already so you might as well give them something to really talk about, lol. Plus, people fear what they don’t understand. They’ll try to tell you you can’t do something because they’re too scared to do it. Don’t let their insecurities and ignorance become yours.

When you love who you are now, who you’re supposed to be will happen automatically.

You are beautiful and don’t let anyone tell you differently. Who you are deep down inside is valid. Your dreams are valid. They are your birthright! You deserve to be happy. You don’t have to continue living this way because we both know it’s keeping you unhappy. I know it’s what you’ve grown accustomed to. I know it feels safe and secure but you are not happy there. You’re quietly killing yourself and no one even notices that you’re silently in so much pain. You hide so much from all of them. But I know better. I notice. You’re not fooling me and you’re not fooling yourself.

You have to make a change for the better and the only way that’s going to happen is if you make a choice. Right here. Right now in the cathedral of your heart that you deserve better for yourself. You have a right to live a happy and full life.

I know you may feel like I don’t understand what you’ve been through. Or it’s not that easy to just change, but it really is. Making a choice is the simplest most difficult thing in the world. There is so much life changing power in making a choice. You have that power.

I know you may not believe this but I mean it from the bottom of my heart: I believe in you. I want to see you be happy. I want to see you. I mean, really see you. Not the you you’ve pretended to be all these years for everyone else, but the you YOU know you are when nobody’s looking. That you is beautiful.

That you deserves a chance to live. That you deserves to realize their dreams. So here’s my challenge for you: 

Get a pen and a pad and write down what you want for your life.

 Write down what’s holding you back.

 Write down what you’re most afraid of. 

And write down what you know deep down you need to do despite how scared you are.

Then do it!

99% of the time we’re scared of rejection and failure.

I read somewhere that ‘Silence is the incubator of fear.’ I believe that to be true. You gotta learn to bathe yourself in the fires of struggle & adversity. Learn to quench your thirst with sweat, blood, and tears. Feed off of rejection & heartbreak and grow stronger so you and only you can forge yourself into something undeniable!

Don’t be afraid to ask for help either. There’s not a problem in this world you can go through that someone, somewhere has not written the solution down in a book somewhere. Seek out the answers.

"Here’s your permission to feel good... A lot of us suppress happiness and joy. We don’t let ourselves do a happy dance when something goes right or feel silly singing in the car alone to a throwback jam. Here’s your permission to DO JUST THAT and let yourself be silly!

"Fun in the summertime I'm screwed 6 ways til Tuesday, but I'm happy. My finances are a mess, and I'll likely never retire, but I'm happy. I'm single, and 40, and sometimes a little scared about that.... But I'm happy. I don't know where I'll live, I don't know what will happen, but I do know I'll survive whatever life throws my way. Just look at what I've already made it through. I miss the old days, I am anxious for the ones to come, but the one I have right now is the best. Because the day I have today is mine to do whatever I please with, no matter my circumstance. My gratitude to the universe for this imperfect day, and all those before and after.",excited,Happiness

I smile because I feel so much joy, and I find it everywhere I look.  
Tragedy, illness, loss, darkness, death...   
It all happens.  
But you choose. 
You can let it consume you, and be dead while you are still living.  
Or...  
You can smile.

So I smile.  
And feel joy.",excited,Happiness
"I finally have found true happiness I was just thinking about what happiness is to me, and I felt compelled to share this.

I used to get quite depressed before, and many of my close friends are even worse than I was. I always wanted a world where everyone could be happy. I recently decided that I just didn't want to be sad anymore, and it kind of worked. I gained a completely new mindset and outlook on life, and it has definitely been for the better. I know that for some people, depression isn't as much of a choice as it is for others. I never went through anything too bad compared to other people's struggles, but I can say that I am so much more happy than before.

The one thing that I discovered, is that happiness is nothing without sadness. I remember not being able to sleep and feeling sick at the fact that my life will end one day. I never realized that without death, life wouldn't be as valuable or meaningful. I have now accepted that I'll pass on one day, and I'm extremely grateful for my life and the time that I do have. Without all the hard times I went through, I don't think my happiness now would feel as good as it does. Anyone can be happy, but it's the rough patches and the bad parts in life that make it a truly wonderful feeling.

To end, here's a quote for you that always motivates me: ""Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, ‘Wow! What a Ride!"" -Hunter S. Thompson",excited,Happiness
"If your workplace has a toxic culture, your voice has more weight than you think - even asking if a colleague is OK can start change Work’s a tough place to be mindful as it sometimes feels you’re rushing from one thing to another. Sometimes that rushing can mean that we’re either worrying about the future or regretting the past, picking over things that haven’t gone as well as we hoped. How do we make work a happy place to be?

An obvious place to start is relationships and communication. When things are busy and we’re feeling anxious, that's when our stress behaviours can surface. We’re less aware of how other people are feeling and of the impact that we have on other people which can sometimes mean we that can say things we later regret. If we train ourselves to be aware when we’re starting to get stressed out, we can breathe, notice the feeling and tend to our anxiety and anger with kindness. We can prioritise what we’re doing - is everything that you’re doing a must do? Can other people help us? The Plum Village app has a timer with a bell that chimes every so often so you can check in with your breath, your body, your thoughts and your feelings. Awareness is the cornerstone of tending to your stress with compassion.

Listening is also incredibly important and powerful in the workplace. We sometimes get caught up in the ‘doing’ completely and forget that building relationships is how big change happens. We’re social animals and we have a bigger impact together, so to do this we need to build deep connections. When we listen to someone with our full awareness, without judging and without jumping to conclusions it’s a genuine act of kindness, particularly if that person is having a difficult time. Deep listening is even more important when we disagree - understanding why someone feels the way they do isn’t the same as agreeing with them and its critical to resolve conflict. Frequently when we feel stressed in work it’s because we don’t feel listened to so it’s important to find people that you can express how you’re feeling to. It’s reasonable to expect your line manager to listen with understanding and respect - it’s part of their role.

Another cause of stress at work is placing pressure on ourselves to get everything right first time and this obviously isn’t realistic, especially if you’re starting a new job. Failure is part of life and key to learning - when something doesn’t go as well as we hoped, its not helpful to point fingers, especially at ourselves. The important thing is to learn, apply, grow and move on. I think as human beings for some reason we keep a book in our head of all the mistakes we ever made. If you’ve learned from the mistake then it’s time to let it go - if you feel your mind bringing out the book of doom and leafing through then rather than being swept away to regrets from the past you can smile to the book and let your mind put it back on the shelf.

And finally what might be the most important, which is looking after each other. When we lift our head up from everyday tasks we can sometimes see that other people are suffering and it’s important not to be a bystander. Checking in on people by asking if they’re OK makes a huge difference - if you think that the wellbeing culture in your workplace isn’t where it needs to be, just be aware that you have much more influence than you think. Just by asking the question of what we want our workplace to be can open a conversation that makes a huge difference to making work a happy, safe and fulfilling place - which is what it should be.

"New Beginnings (188) New beginnings. They can be scary, they can be filled with joy, anxiety, fear etc., t**hey are meant for a reason.** 

**We all need new beginnings. To push what we know, to push the path and journey that we have been on.** To learn new. To experience new.

Either way it will happen easily, or it will happen with resistance. The choice is all in our hands, at the same time of letting go and letting the Universe.

Blue skies, goosebumps, changes being made after a long time of hard work. When it happens, give your hand out for others, don't hold it all for yourself.

Our world is abundant, our life is abundant, **we are abundant. Every single being.** We have to do the internal work to unlock that abundance, **we all need to do internal work and be comfortable with the uncomfortable.** 

**The only thing that will constantly stay the same in our life is change, let go.**

"Seven key attitudes for a happy life according to Jon Kabat Zinn **Non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise. JKZ talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral. By taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives. Of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.


**Patience** - letting things unfold in their own time. Meditation isn’t difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence. It takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it. Doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you’re training yourself to be happy. Its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we’re not aware of. 


**Beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities. Knowledge can limit our perception of what we don’t know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don’t know. When we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.


**Trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses. Trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be OK - because it really will. When we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we’re not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we’re existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value. Really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections. 


**Non-striving** - we’re always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination. But an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now. We can’t live happily in the future; if everything we’re doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present. We tell ourselves we’ll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire. This is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we’re with.


**Acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are. Which is not to say you don’t do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do. There’s a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you OK with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true! When we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear. 


**Letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances. Once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.

"The cure for loneliness - accepting our fear and building our compassion for others One of the grim features of modern life is loneliness - we can be in a crowd of people but still feel alone, all of us lonely together. That feeling is something that we're afraid of; the fear of loneliness can be worse than the feeling itself, resulting in us trying to distract ourselves with other things.

When we’re feeling blue we distract ourselves by turning the TV on, having a snack or a drink, or going on Youtube. Consumption will make us feel a little better for a moment but only makes the problem worse in the long term, even social media is something for us to consume rather than offering a real human connection.

To begin to tend to our loneliness we can focus our awareness on how we’re feeling. We don’t have to be afraid of loneliness, it’s a normal part of the human experience. We have evolved as a social animal, so when we’re spending a lot of time alone or we’re not making a real connection with others we’re motivated to come together. Shine the light of awareness on the feeling, listen to it. As crazy as it sounds, loneliness is your friend and is just looking out for you.

Its also worth being aware of how we feel about making new friends. Everyone has anxiety around meeting new people which can get in the way of connecting with people. We wonder what people think about us, we worry that we’re  being judged, we build it up in our heads until the point where we think that it’s better not to try. But we can get around this block by accepting that we’re feeling anxious about meeting people and examining whether our fears are true. For example - will people really judge us, or will they just accept us at face value?

Practicing compassion and becoming interested in other people is the most important way to tend to our loneliness. When we develop our calm / peace, we start to focus less on ourselves and more on others. We notice their needs and see the everyday suffering of other people. We feel compelled to act and to help that person, even if the help is just listening deeply without judgement. When you really listen and allow someone to empty their heart, that's when you can really make a human connection.

"Change Comes Either Way (71) We think that change is a choice. We think change is in our control. Change happens. If we like it or not. We are constantly changing everyday moment, every second, every minute, every hour which ultimately will lead to every day, every week, month, year and so on. 

Our life in the past 9 months has been filled of unprecedented times, chaos but has allowed us to be given a sense of time to sit with ourself, sit in solidarity. These past months have been filled with lots of highs and lots of downs. We must sit in it all. We must focus on our passions, on our crafts, on what we have been given to feel and resonate with. We all have different things inside of us, different likes, dislikes, attributes, characteristics, insecurities, struggles, strengths, things that make us happy etc. We are all unique. We are all 1 of 1. We are all sacred. 

For every moment we are given we have to realize that we must be thankful and grateful for it. This analogy always creates a sort of confuzzle inside of me. The sense of only living for today as if this is the only day I have but as well as that our life is long & that we will live for another 30, 40, 50, 60 years etc. Do something today that makes you feel alive, if you don't know what that is, well sit present for a few moments and allow it to come to you; it will come.

These times have been difficult. These times have been challenging, but with challenges comes growth. With things that question our comfort zones, that question everything we have always known comes a realignment, naturally and organically. It all takes time and I am grateful for the time that it takes, even if sometimes I want to get there already (my dysphoria & transitioning). 

We will get to where we want to go but most of the time, it will be better than what we set out to achieve and that we expect that we will achieve. Keep doing your best. Today, Tomorrow and for the rest of the week until the end of the year. Work your hardest and leave it all on the field. I wish you well.

I love you.

"Question on Nostalgia and Happiness. I read a lot about ""letting go"" of the past and ""moving on"" from the past as being key to happiness. And I think like everyone I've got a lot of burdens and pains in my past. But there are also many joys. There are fond memories of amusement parks and apple-picking, old friends who've drifted away, lost loves, and so on.  


These things brought me such joy back then, but now, when I think about them, I get bombarded with negative thoughts like ""Things were so much better back in the day"" and ""Too bad that'll never happen again"" I always tell my students ""Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"".

"I tried to achieve happiness all my life only to realise it can just hit you out of nowhere I tried searching for happiness through people, destructive things, and even non-destructive things like meditation and staying clear of negative people but I just kept going back to feeling useless. I thought nothing would make me happy until one day I looked at what was important, and I realised popularity, materialistic possessions, monetary wealth- they mean nothing if you're always scrambling for happiness. Something hit me and I'd never felt anything like it before. Suddenly people's statuses and pictures just seems uninteresting to me and I completely rearranged my social media and deleted almost all pictures of me. Why did I even have them up? Vanity? Can't be, because I can't usually stand the way I look. I did it because everybody else did and I wanted to fit in. But suddenly I felt like fitting in was the last thing I wanted. Nowadays I'm happy living more minimalistic, spending my free time doing creative activities and reading rather than constantly looking for validation from the people I know but whom are barely even in my life anymore. People don't want to meet up because they're happy staying inside talking to people online, if at all, but I'm ready to see the real world.

People used to get to me, and I was a sensitive soul. I could argue about politics or my beliefs until I was blue in the face, but now I keep my opinions and beliefs to myself. I don't care that people think differently, only as long as they don't use it to be hateful and spiteful. I find that I don't get angry anymore, like nothing anybody says can hurt me, because only I can judge me. Others can *try*, but they'll never know who you truly are and what's truly in your heart, so as long as **you** know you are pure hearted, honest, and kind- people really can never hurt you again. You are in complete control. It's like nothing I've ever felt, like I'm in a constant state of calm because I finally accept who I am. Living honestly and unapologetic for who I am is the best decision I've ever made, and people are respecting me a LOT more, and that's because I respect myself.

I've got a lot going on in my life and I've been through a lot, but I'm prepared to drop all the sadness and let it go. I feel like this is the first step, and I have a long way to go, but right now I'm on the up. Here's to happiness!",excited,Happiness

"If your happiness depends on someone or something happening, you're setting yourself up for suffering. Nothing is guaranteed, so let go of your ""if onlys"" and build your happiness in the here and now If you think about what you need to be happy, you might think about achieving something in your career, or a relationship, or something you own. All of these things have something in common - they're conditions for happiness. As human beings we naturally get attached to goals and the status quo.

The bad news is that not everything in our career goes as we would like, relationships can end, possessions break and are lost. The good news is that you can enjoy what you have right now and be happy, even if the only thing that you possess is the ability to breathe in and out. 

By letting go of our attachment to things that we believe we need to be happy we can actually live calmer, happier lives. Of course its great to enjoy the things we own, the people we love and our work - but accepting that life will change and that we don't need external conditions for happiness reduces the suffering we feel when things don't go as we hope.

"7 Tips to live a happier life  

How do we find more joy in our life? Like anything else, it takes practice to cultivate ongoing happiness. In a sense, we have to reset our baseline. It won't happen overnight, but here are the top 7 things you can do every day to discover the secrets of being happier.

1. Focus on the positive.

To find long-term happiness, you need to retrain your brain from a negative mindset to a positive mindset. Try these things: Spend[ ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2016/12/21/how-to-train-your-brain-to-go-positive-instead-of-negative/#2552c5f15a58)one to two minutes looking for positives in your life. Do this three times a day for 45 days, and your brain will start doing it automatically.

Choose a positive mantra for the day -- something you will repeat to yourself, such as “Today is beautiful” or “I feel grateful for all I have.” And when things go south, take a moment to try and see it from a positive light. Never underestimate the importance of recognizing the silver linings in life.

2. Celebrate little victories.

Life is full of ups and downs, but in between we have a lot of little victories that go unnoticed. Take a moment to celebrate these small wins.

Did you check off all the things on your to-do list that you’ve been procrastinating on? Yay! Did you finally clear out a thousand emails that have been filling up your inbox? Woohoo! Take pleasure in these little achievements. They add up!

3. Find your work–life balance.

Work takes up a lot of our day, but it shouldn’t be the only thing we do. It’s important to pursue activities and interests beyond our job. Do you have a hobby? Are you spending time with friends and loved ones? Are you getting exercise? Creating balance in your life will reduce stress and give you other outlets to express yourself and have fun.

4. Practice mindfulness.

Mindfulness mediation works by bringing your awareness and attention to the present moment. It’s about being nonjudgmental and accepting how you are feeling. Practicing mindfulness means being present, aware and curious. Accepting what we are going through decreases stress and helps us see situations for what they are. Through mindfulness, we can find peace and affirmation in ourselves.

5. Be creative.

You may think of artists as being moody and depressed, but studies show that engaging in creative activities on a regular basis actually makes you happier. Those who spend time using their imagination and being creative have more enthusiasm and are more likely to have feelings of long-term happiness and well-being. Such creative activities can include writing, painting, drawing and musical performance.

6. Accept imperfection.

Many of us strive for perfection -- we desire to push ourselves to be our best. But in order to be truly happy, you must[ ](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bojana-jankovic/how-to-be-your-best-self-embrace-your-imperfection_b_9586828.html)embrace the imperfection that is part of life. Perfection is impossible, and holding ourselves and others to these standards is futile. We will always end up feeling let down.

7. Do what you love.

It’s pretty hard to maintain happiness if you hate your job. Don’t waste the best years of your life in a joyless job, even if it’s paying the bills. What are you interested in? What are you truly passionate about?

"How my most toxic relationship turned out my best My boyfriend and I were young and prideful when we first met, it went so wrong and was my worst HEARTBREAK. (He was my first love and I didn’t realize it) 
We are now two years later together and he’s the best thing that happened to me. 
Happiness is seeing my timid boyfriend break out of his cocoon and spread out his wings with me
Happiness is being able to  tell him I’m on my way or out of therapy and him not making me feel like I’m a weirdo (believe me people will act crazy once they hear the word therapy) 
Happiness is seeing how far (this time) we’ve come along
Happiness is laughing at things no one would laugh at BUT us 
Happiness is him accepting I have mental illnesses  & not making me feel psycho or different 
Happiness is him knowing I’m agoraphobic and still pushing me enough to go out on dates but not too much when he makes me feel bad if I can’t (we are still working on it) 
Happiness is him calling me every night after he gets out of work, no matter how late (he works the afternoon/night shift) 
Happiness is him letting me be my own person and focusing myself on MY happiness and still not making me feel alone 
Happiness is feeling loved, genuinely loved 
Happiness is where for once you don’t feel like you’re relationship will take a huge turn at any moment  
Although I never thought this would happen and I’m not supporting toxic relationships (ladies respect yourselves) I’m immensely grateful this is my person and we GREW UP genuinely. 
I love being loved and love loving him.

"If there was simple little way to create more happiness in your life, would you? Nothing lasts forever. 
Happiness is not an achieved level of such emotions, but frequency. 
According to research, frequently doing tiny habits in your mundane schedule is the secret in achieving the holy grail. 
The tiny habits of happiness construct a happier you. 

Looking back, I’ve felt truly happy from the following little things.
-A brisk morning walk with my puppy
-Taking a foot bath before sleep
-Meditation with my favorite aroma oil
-Finally cleaning my room
-Finishing the daily to-do list

I want to habituate the tiny actions of happiness for a happier life.

"The THREE MOST important activities for HAPPINESS ~ Sleep, Exercise, Face to Face Socialization  

**The three most important activities for happiness are sleep, exercise and face to face socialization**.  A 2019 report from the world happiness organization aligns with this statement.

What I can say is **I am not surprised**.  The easiest way to wreck your mood is to get poor quality sleep.  In fact, for high schoolers, a good night's rest is **the most important factor for being happy**.  When you wake up well rested life is groovy and you're excited to take on the day.  Life becomes simpler when you sleep well.  You just simply live your life to the fullest when the sun is up and then sleep well at night.  We made a HUGE mistake letting excessive television viewing, phone use, computer use creep into our lives, exposing us to blue light at night and taking away quality sleep.  It's about time you regain your freedom from the wrath of electronics.  **Turn off and get to bed.** 

Next up is sports and exercise.  Movement releases a bunch of feel good neurotransmitters.  Further, it helps build a self-identity and gives us a name in our community.  Virtually every fun thing you do in life revolves around movement.  **Further, movement is inherently present-based.**  You can only ""move through space"" in the present moment.  A bit trippy and philosophical but it's something that has stuck with me for a long time.  Our minds can time travel (to the past, future) but our conscious minds are more like a rolling video in the present.  The more we sit, the more we ruminate.  When we move and play a sport you are somewhat forced to stay present in the here and now.  That's the true beauty of doing things.  

Third, in person face to face interaction.  We're all guilty of not doing enough of this.  We take the easy way out and text or snap our friends.  I think we'd be better off meeting up more in person and actually doing fun stuff together instead of sitting around and coming up with witty text responses to group chats.  

This is very simple stuff.  Simple lifestyle changes are the key to not only getting shredded and jacked, but also being happier.

**Your phone- a time and happiness sink**

Virtually every form of ""electronic engagement"" takes away from happiness; TV, internet, talking on cell, video chat, texting, social media, computer games and even listening to music on your phone."" pushes us away from happiness long-term.

Chart from (A)

The chart above is based correlation which does not prove cause and effect however and intervention study points to the fact that social media use may be the root cause of loneliness and depressive symptoms:

In the study, **social media use was limited down to a half hour a day in the test group.**  They had some great benefits\~ decrease in symptoms of depression and loneliness(B).  

**But aren't our phones connecting us? (What is really going on here!?)**

A lot of us may feel more connected when we use our phones but in reality it has the opposite effect, creating lonely habits.  Instead of meeting up a with in person to talk, we'll shoot over a couple texts.  **Phones can create an illusion of connectedness when you're swimming in a sea of loneliness.**  

Further, since we compare ourselves to others on social media (and there is usually always someone ""better off"" in virtually every aspect of life), we start to value our own uniqueness a little less.  One subject said it best:

“Not comparing my life to the lives of others had a much stronger impact than I expected, and I felt a lot more positive about myself during those weeks.” (B)

**A few simple lifestyle changes could really turn your life around for the better:**

\~Give up some TV or phone scrolling for more sleep

\~Spend less time indoors and play a sport, game or exercise with friends

\~Spend less time texting/calling people and instead opt for in person face to face conversation

Those are the BIG THREE of feeling good.

**SLEEP.** 

**MOVE OUTSIDE.** 

**INTERACT (IN PERSON)**.

"Happiness is being me 💓💕 I'm brilliant. I mean, really freaking brilliant. I'm gifted and talented and astoundingly intelligent. I'm beautiful on the outside, according to societies standards, but it hasn't stopped me from being incredibly kind and compassionate, and just lovely on the inside. I strive, everyday, to have more empathy, more humility, and a better understanding of others than I had the day before. I'm ambitious *and* driven, and while I've got plenty of flaws and challenges, I look at them as great treasures to be discovered, because they are awesome accomplishments, that lay in wait, to be conquered.  I see them as character building blocks, rather than reasons for feeling inferior. I can't believe I got so lucky in life to be me. I'd never want to be anyone else. I know that others won't always agree with me, but I don't mind. We all are different, which is what makes each one of us a unique opportunity for greatness. I love life, I love everything in it. I love everything I have in this life, despite what I do not have. What I have is just perfect for me, if I want it, and I do. There are always ways I want to improve my current model, but I'd never change the person I am. And *that* my friends, is sublime.",excited,Happiness
"Happiness is.... ...My big, warm, queen-sized bed with the perfect mattress topper, a million pillows and sherpa blankets, and only me in it. It's my candlelit room decorated just so, and inviting as hell, with everything I like to do within arm's reach.  It's my bed on the lowest profile frame I can find, so low to the ground it's almost on it. It's the lighting, the scent, the freshly potted plants, the sheer curtains that flutter the the sun's light. It's waking up each morning so happy to see me! It's my woodwick candle still burning in the far corner at my feet, tricking me every time to believe there is raindrops on my window, in the early morning light.     
  
It's working hard, having little, and appreciating everything. It's the moment of right here. Right now. It's my dog, it's my kids, it's progress, its cleaning on a Saturday night, it's the magic of the internet, it's the beauty of color, and the brilliance of light. It's the lessons of mistakes, and the magnificence of healing. It's the thrill of self empowerment, and the humility of defeat. It's the peace within that comes from faith, and the serenity of stillness.

"Bird Calls (198) We rush through life. We always have this pressure, to do better, to be stronger, to work harder, but we forget to give time and space for ourselves. 

The roads can get bumpy and thats ok. We can slip, fall down, get back up, walk a little, slip again and still want to get up; **to keep going.**

**I have realized lately how important it is to put time and love into ourselves fully, not half fasting it, not only sometimes, but to put ourselves first.**

The winds are calm, the winds are strong, what is felt will come and go, what we learn stays. **We are present, we are strong, we are weak, we are looking forward to the future.** Everything is done with what we have. 

**Little energy, lots, or none. Push through or give ourselves the time and space needed to breathe, to be.**

Everything is ok.

"The Ancient Greek Concept of EUDAIMONIA has a really interesting take on supreme happiness I’ve been trying to introduce as many people as possible to Stoic philosophy and show them all of the things that I’ve learned from it.

One my absolute favorite pieces of this philosophy is the pursuit of supreme happiness, otherwise known as **Eudaimonia.**

Eudaimonia translates to being on good terms with the highest version of yourself, which I’m positive is something I think we should all aspire to.

This concept is often represented as a triangle with 3 core aspect to it

1. Live with Areté - This is about being the best version of yourself and making choices accordingly
2. Focus on What You can Control - One of the fundamental tenets of Stoic philosophy. Remember that we can’t change what already is, but we can choose what to do with the given circumstances.
3. Take Responsibility - In Stoicism, it’s explained that it’s not an external situation that makes us happy or miserable, but our interpretation of that situation.

All 3 corners work hand in hand with each other to move you closer to a more fulfilling life of joy and satisfaction. I explain this in depth here and describe how it has changed my life too - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USvBd6Mxewo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USvBd6Mxewo)

No matter what happens to us, we should **focus on what we control**, **take responsibility** for our judgment of the situation, and then **live with Areté** by choosing to express our best self.",excited,Happiness
"Choosing, tracking, and data visualizing all of the happiness A few weeks back I posted my [happiness spreadsheet](https://accidentallyretired.com/resources/happiness-tracker-spreadsheet/502) for anyone interested in tracking their daily happiness. In doing my monthly happiness review this month, I wanted to visualize my happiness even more than the spreadsheet has to offer. I was able to find a nice Google Chart Data Visualization that can take all of my calendar and happiness data and turn it into something useful.

Here is the result:

I am a visual person, so I pumped to be able to really look at my happiness in this way.

I never had a lot of red/bad days to begin with, but I am glad to see that most of my bad days are becoming fewer and farther spaced apart.

Plus, there are becoming less white days as well. If every day can turn into a green…well now I am really onto something!

For me, tracking happiness by giving it a value has helped me to *emphasize my happiness* day after day:

* I make better choices.
* I start each day fresh.
* I chose to do more things that make me happy.
* I chose to be more present in the moment (because that makes me happier).
* I chose to do things to make others happy, because I now realize that it makes me happier as well.

"It works out with Hard Work (142) **Little by little, we progress, we move forward.** We have to remember its not about doing 100 different things daily, you definitely can, but its about **consistency**. Doing 1 thing a day towards your goal is better than doing 100 things in one day and then not doing anything more for a few weeks. **Stay consistent.**

We here the quote **""Work Smarter, Not Harder""**, well remember that we can do both simultaneously but the most important thing like we said is **consistency.** 

Everything takes time, so know that **you're exactly where you're meant to be, right now. Say it out loud ""I am exactly where I am meant to be"", keep saying it until the anxiety or rush to get to the next task subsides**.

We are going through times that most of us have never experienced before so its ok to give yourself time to rest, its ok to give yourself time to be still; **to meditate, get fresh air and just enjoy this present moment.**

**I am proud of you. I know you're doing your best, however ""your best"" looks like, its important for YOUR STORY and JOURNEY.** You're not late, you're not behind, **you're EXACTLY where you're meant to be.**

"Understanding Yourself (132) Up until a little while ago, I always wanted others to see me how I see myself, but even with working up the courage to share my personal vulnerabilities, I sometimes am met with other peoples ignorance. 

I have learned that the only person that needs to understand me, **is myself.** Interesting analogy? Creating barriers? Its really the **exact opposite**. We can only be are our true self, when **we believe who we are is true & step into that truth**. We aren't here to convince, we aren't here to make others see our own way because the truth is, they can only see, **when they are ready to look. Others ""aren't"" ready, because they have their own pain, insecurities and vulnerabilities that must be met with first before embracing who I am/you are, as we all have.** 

**Understand yourself.** Put the work in daily to learning. I do this, by doing things that feed and fill my soul, rather then trying to people please, **something else I am healing from.** Meditation, Gratitude lists, being outside, painting, focusing on a new passion, writing **etc., try things that you feel in your heart.** 

People will understand you eventually or not, but don't wait for their validation/affirmation **for you to step into your truth. Be your truth now. Slowly. Remember though, everything takes time and the only thing we can do daily, is our best. Lets do our best. Together, Separately.**

"Living Life's Truth (75) We all have hardships, we all deal with pain, we all deal with anxiety, we all deal with depression, heartbreak, friendships being removed, comfort zones being pushed, facing fears, facing ourselves. **Embracing.** **We Live On.**

We are all so strong. We are strong to sit with our pains, anxieties and depression. We are strong to be self aware of how and what we are feeling. 

Through the Grace of God, The Universe, The Divine, The Higher Power, we are **ALWAYS being** Protected, Guided and Supported. Everything in life takes time, everything in life is moment by moment, is minute by minute, is hour by hour, is day by day, week by week, month by month and so on.

We must life for **right now.** That is all we have, **this present moment.** 

My spiritual journey started a few years back when one morning I was triggered, triggered to the point of my body consuming and allowing my own angers & anxieties to wreck and destroy my morning, I thought to myself ""there has to be more"" as well as ""I don't want to feel this way anymore"", "" I want to change the way I react & respond"" rather than just letting myself take in someone else's projected pain, anger and sadness.

It has taken time, I am working on it everyday, every moment. Through the ups, through the downs, through my own moments of lack of Faith and Trust, God always guides me through and allows me to know that everything is for **MY HIGHEST and GREATEST SELF.** It really is just that. The hardships we experience, the anxieties, the set backs, are **REALLY** solely for the purpose of **REALIGNMENT**. Our **GREATEST Gift.**

I just want you to know, you reading this, that **YOU** are not alone. There 1000's of people that are coping, embracing and healing from the same thing that we all are in this very moment and with that thought, it makes it truly relieving. Relieving to know that **WE** are all in this together. **Together, Separately.** 

**Today:** Be present. Give yourself a few moments, minutes to be in the moment through whatever that is **YOU love** doing; Meditating, Being outside, Writing, Painting etc etc. I Wish you **HEALTH, HAPPINESS & HEALING** Gentle Soul. You are **LOVED, CARED ABOUT &**

**VALID.**

"Breathe in the Midst of a Storm (73) Everyday we start Anew. Everyday is a new start to do something you wanted to yesterday. Its taking 1 step at a time and releasing the thought of finishing whatever it may be you want to work towards. The journey of life is through the ups, through the downs and everything in between; what we have, is our perspective, our mindset and our presence. 

**The past few years** have been **rocky**, moving to a new city, starting life over, having to move out suddenly, change my life again which was all unexpected. Then, Covid, unexpected, then forcing me into solitude to sit with myself. Sit in my alcohol abuse/drug abuse and allow it to unravel, release and unlearn. Then; coming to terms with my identity and acknowledging that I am **Trans**, which at first was filled with happiness but as well as shame, doubt, sadness, pain & joy.

We as human beings all live lives as waves. There are moments that can be very hard and make us feel the worst, as well as moments that bring us happiness and joy from the smallest of things. The journey of life is a process, it has to be this way, everything. Without the lows, we would never know when we are happy, without the highs, we would never know when we are feeling down and know that something must be changed. The life lived with feeling all emotions is such a unique perspective, it allows us to know that we are human beings and we are **ALIVE.**

We all are hurting. We all are in pain. We all are just trying to figure ourselves out. We all are feeling all the feels. We all have moments of gratitude. We all have moments of happiness. We all have moments of presence. 

Sitting in your feelings, sitting in your pain, is such a strength. It has taken me time, through the constant self induced numbing, defence mindset and saying ""i'm ok"", when really I wasn't & thats ok. I am still learning who I am everyday. I am still feeling pain, sadness and all the feels, everyday. 

I want to say that, **I LOVE YOU &** I know things may be **TOUGH** right now, but I know that if you are reading this, if you realize it or not, **YOU ARE TRYING & YOU ARE HEALING. WE ALL ARE. I wish you well.** 

**Always here if you want to chat or want someone to listen.** 

I love you.

"Doing Best (68) In the past few months, there has been moments of ups, moments of downs; moments that made me pause, moments that have made me work hard. In all of those moments I have been forced to realize that with everything day, the best I can do is that in itself. 

  
What is this mindset that we have been conditioned to think we always have to be working? Why do we think this way? We must live in this present moment as if this is our only day, but as well as continue to have that mindset that our life is long, difficult, I know, I am right there with you.

  
Even when we do our best, what will come from that will usually be much different than our expectations. We can create goals, set intentions, but God and the Universe will always guide us to something better. It is all for our best self, all for our highest self. 

  
The life of being an entrepreneur definitely is bliss but with that, comes many struggles and different things that you have to make sure you make yourself accountable for. Accountability is the only way that we can continue to move forward, in this present moment. 

  
A few things that help me everyday to maintain presence is spending time in nature, meditation, journaling, painting, trying something new, playing video games and reading new context.  
Today: Give yourself a hug. Tell Yourself you are **ENOUGH**. "" I Am Enough "". Sending you health and happiness on your journey today.

"What Makes Life Fulfilling? Lately with everything going on in the world, I've been reflecting on what are some of the most important things that makes life truly special. For me at least I believe that some our greatest joys all start from being curious, whether it be in our relationships, in our education, or in our hobbies. The thought of growing older and losing this curiosity seems to bother me, since without it, I think life would feel dull and meaningless. We wouldn't have much of a desire to understand the workings of ourselves and environment.

"Switch off your autopilot - it's difficult to change your life when you're unhappy and stuck in a rut but the place to start is in your awareness of the little choices in every moment you make without thinking We go through our world, so used to making the same choices again and again, that it becomes very difficult to change things when we’re unhappy. But if we train ourselves to stop regularly, to be present and consciously make good choices rather than being on autopilot we can transform our suffering. 

A bit of regular practice like a guided meditation is important - but you can also stop for a moment a few times through the day,  notice your breath, become aware of what you can feel in your body, what you’re thinking and feeling. Training yourself in this way helps to raise awareness of the choices we have.

In mindfulness we call the decisions we make ‘watering the seeds’. These everyday choices can contribute to our anger, our happiness, our fear - just in the same way that if you choose to water certain plants in your garden, you’re choosing what your future garden looks like. Being aware of decisions and prioritising your wellbeing as the most important factor makes a huge difference over time. Peace in oneself, peace in the world.

"Stop trying to bring your happiness to 10/10 and you'll be happier By constantly striving to get your happiness to 10/10, you are actually likely complicating your life and may ultimately become less happy.  More kids, pets,  bigger house, a packed schedule, and job with more responsibility will only give you a brief reward of happiness before the added stress brings you back to or below your level of happiness from before. Then you'll be back to trying to complicate your life more to get from that 7/10 to a 10/10.

If your life is simple and your happiness is already 7/10, embrace it. If you're thinking, ""my life is so great, it would be perfect if I just had ____"", try to decide if adding that thing could actually take away from your current happiness more than add to it.  A 20 year old working at a fast food restaurant but with no other responsibilities and few possessions may truly be happier than the 40 year old with a stressful job, family of 4, house, and fancy car.  Maybe the only problem with the 20 year old's life is that society thinks their life sucks because they can't afford fancy things like a Fiji vacation, and that we need those things to be fulfilled. It's also the attitude that we need to drive and fly all over the planet and consume everything in sight that is destroying our planet and will ultimately make everyone's life less enjoyable.

"Happiness is the fruit that bears once we exit the rat race Wednesday doesn't exist. The days of the week don't mean much to us anymore, because we often don't even know what day of the week it even is. It's almost like we turn on autopilot on Monday, and we don't snap out of it until someone mentions that it's ""almost Friday."" It's as if we live in a trance, inside the artificial world of our workplace where in order to to have financial freedom, we play the role of an extra in a really shitty theatre play, interacting with other uncommitted characters.

Most of us are wise enough to know that most jobs aren't designed to create wealth, but rather help us make just enough to survive and help pay rent and minimum payments on our loans. And yet, we still participate in the race because it is more acceptable than branching out and doing something of our own.

We need equity in companies, investment in ourselves and businesses and a lot more education (financial and spiritual) to exit the rat race, and actually begin to not only taste freedom, but handle it well. To be independent, we must take risks and begin to act as independent people. And then, we can work with other equally independent people to develop our own inter-dependent network.

But for any of this to happen, we must begin to start snapping out of this trance, this autopilot, the illusion of a dream-killer: that we always have tomorrow. We can't really live today in constant anxiety of securing our future when that anxiety is what prohibits us from taking risks and taking the actual steps to building a better today, each day. The future will eventually arrive, but let's not drug ourselves with a paycheck until we finally get there. Let's meet it as if we were preparing to meet a good friend--intentionally and consciously--and preferably in good health.",excited,Happiness
"You can do it! Tuesday is another step towards a better life Tuesdays are not an often talked about day. By now, most people have gotten used to the misery of Monday, thinking that it will be easier from here on out. We've already endured the classically worst day of the week, and we are one step closer to the weekend. But there are many of us who might pick up a Saturday shift, or, in our current jobs will physically be at work for a minimum of 8 hours. So this way of thinking is fooling ourselves; the weekend is not free time. 

It is difficult to persuade someone to free themselves, once they've gotten used to the weight of their chains. But these chains can be unshackled at any time, if we realize that what we do isn't who we are; we are not our work, and our work is not us. But what we do for most of the day determines our temperament for the rest of the day. Maybe we will be used to the grind of our work, and the abusive nature of our managers and coworkers. And when we finally get home at the end of the day, we will be just as tired as we were yesterday. 

We will be convinced that we don't have the energy to put forth an hour or so, of time to start digging ourselves out of this trench to invest in our side business or learning a new skill. But we can do it. Just don't believe the illusion that everything is okay when it is not. Perhaps some boundaries in our personal life and work have long been demolished by people who benefitted from us not having them; and the best way to reclaim our space again is to create a new identity for ourselves where we love what we do, and, at the very least, we respect ourselves. If we missed Monday, we can still get on the train this Tuesday to a new destination. Every day is an opportunity.",excited,Happiness
"It really is the small things Life has been nothing but goddamn chaos for the past two or so years. The past few months have been just as chaotic but in a good way for a change.  Which is a win in of itself. However, tonight I took my pup, got some shitty greasy food and shared it. Then went off to a park and walked for a long time. The sun was setting and it’s 72 outside.  I don’t remember the last time I felt so at peace. I forgot what it was like to just enjoy and be in the moment like that.  To just be. Idk how since I used to be THAT person.  Regardless, I’m so so happy I found her again.

"The Power of Positive Thinking Do you have a favorite positive affirmation, quote, photo, song, etc. that always boosts your mood?

One of my favorite quotes is: ""And once the storm is over, you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about."" -- Haruki Murakima",excited,Happiness

"How do I beat the Hedonic Treadmill? The life I'm living right now would be unfathomable to myself of two years ago or even a year ago. I'm doing better than ever in school, I have more friends than ever and I'm closer to them than before, I'm talking way more with my family, I got fit, I fell in love with music and played one of the largest festivals in my country, and although I have no SO atm I'm meeting amazing women left and right and actually maintaining contact with them (before I could barely talk to girls). Given, all of this came to me gradually, but I can't figure out WHY it doesn't click in my mind that my situation is so much better now. I know a bit of dissatisfaction is necessary to want to improve, but this is just a depressing amount. Any tips on getting out of this funk?

"I realized something! having low expectations leads to happiness, but there's a step after that.... The science of happiness talks about low expectations as the true key... you can research it, but it is basically factual that low expectations lead to happiness and compassion, because as soon as expectations climb, you reach entitlement, and nothing goes flawlessly for long. But the thing I realized is that I am not lowering expectations, although I am generally happy. There are times I mitigate my expectation, internally, but it's very rare that I have high expectations for things, and in this, I am generally a very happy person. However, the next step is like walking through a doorway to consciousness: Don't have any expectations. It is possible that forcing a lack of expectation is not possible, or it might just be a zen like excercise. But when it happens, and you exist without expectation, it isn't just about being happy, but you enter this new flow of existence. The nearest I could describe it is just ""being"". People talk of that in eastern religious / philosophical circles, but the concept is hard to derive, because it is either an overly simplistic notion, or one that is riddled with inaccessibility. So this might be a path.... control expectation by reducing it, and hopefully one can climb over the threshold to simply existing, being, and not having any expectations. I know we're not emotionally consistent beings, and I can have a bad day tomorrow. Or today... but this is something I've been practicing to have it exist somewhat naturally. And that's all I have to say about that.",excited,Happiness
"How to live a happier life and sleep better too! I have observed that in my area, there is a lot of money in the hands of the people who flock to Florida seeking fun, greater happiness and a better way of life. In truth, don't we all seek those attributes but struggle to achieve? People can't wait to retire so they can enjoy some fun, greater happiness and a better way of life yet we should be aspiring to live our lives that way on a day-to-day basis. I can even say that if you can ideally strive to consciously live your life in a healthier way, which includes being mindful of your thoughts, you actually will enjoy a better and healthier lifestyle and a better night sleep.

I would like to speak to how you can sleep better on a regular basis and still lead an active and successful lifestyle. I believe that most of us would like to end our day by relaxing our energy yet we place very little importance on how we can accomplish that feat.

Here are some suggestions that I can make to you that have helped me calm my energy daily, release unwarranted nervous activity of my mind and body and allowed me to live without pills and medication.


1. I attempt to surround myself with positive thinking people and environments as much as possible.


2. Spend less time texting, reading e-mails and gossiping. While we may need to utilize those tools on a regular basis, we also need to discipline our use so that it does not overpower our lives; instead it will save our lives.


3. I center my mind often during the day to keep my focus on what is important to make my life work and to also enable me to work smarter.


4. I frequently say mantras to calm my energy and remove over activity of my mind that, too often, is trying to lead me towards negative emotions, such as, fear, worry, guilt and resentment. I even go so far as give my ego mind instructions so that it does not control me but rather, gives me the control. An example might be: Ego Mind, go count all my blessings in my life. That simple statement allows me to focus on where I need to place my energy-on positive thoughts, ideas and creative tools.


5. Seek contentment, inner calmness and a belief that it is achievable daily. When you live your life on purpose and have a real reason for living, you tend to be happier and more satisfied with who you are and what you are doing.


6. Establish a real sense of self-confidence. When you do, you are better prepared to set reasonable boundaries for your life which include identifying with your core values and what you treasure.


I work at clearing my mind nightly from all those items that cause me stress, anxiety and/or frustration. My evenings are the time of day when I need to relax and calm my energy field so that I can ultimately sleep peacefully. I work at it and I suggest if you want to enjoy a pleasant night sleep, you too, will need to work at it.

In summary, believe that it is important to quiet your mind, calm your energy and body and aim to release all worry, fear and activity of your daily life that will compromise an improved sense of inner peace and relaxation. That is how you too will be better prepared to live a happier life and sleep better too!",excited,Happiness
"Stay Happy The 92-year-old, petite, well-poised and proud lady, who is fully dressed each morning by eight o’clock, with her hair fashionably coifed and makeup perfectly applied, even though she is legally blind, moved to a nursing home today. Her husband of 70 years recently passed away, making the move necessary. After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home, she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready. As she maneuvered her walker to the elevator, I provided a visual description of her tiny room, including the eyelet sheets that had been hung on her window. “I love it,” she stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old having just been presented with a new puppy. “Mrs. Jones, you haven’t seen the room …. just wait.” “That doesn’t have anything to do with it,” she replied. “Happiness is something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not doesn’t depend on how the furniture is arranged, it’s how I arrange my mind. I already decided to love it. It’s a decision I make every morning when I wake up. I have a choice; I can spend the day in bed recounting the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer work, or get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do. Each day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open I’ll focus on the new day and all the happy memories I’ve stored away, just for this time in my life.” She went on to explain, “Old age is like a bank account, you withdraw from what you’ve put in. So, my advice to you would be to deposit a lot of happiness in the bank account of memories Thank you for your part in filling my Memory bank. I am still depositing.” And with a smile, she said: “Remember the five simple rules to be happy: 1. Free your heart from hatred. 2. Free your mind from worries. 3. Live simply. 4. Give more. 5. Expect less.",excited,Happiness
"The Two Most Important Rules of a Happy & Successful Life (lessening anxiety and depression) Hello Fellow Reddits, 

There is a far greater need for more happiness in the world, than I need to get paid for this little e-book I'm sharing with all of you for free. I created this out of my own desire to find my way out of anxiety. I hope this bullet list gives you a little boost and insight into maintaining happiness.

The Two Most Important Rules of a Happy & Successful Life are... 
Love yourself and love others. Sounds easy, right? But what does that really mean?  How do we do that? How do we achieve that state of being? There are many layers to it.

Loving yourself means:

-CHOOSE to be a CREATOR of your life - rather than a VICTIM.
It is time to decide what is most important to you. Love, hate, fear or doubt? Funny as it sounds, these are the choices you are making in every moment. Hate is based on what you feel has already happened to you. Fear is worrying about what might happen. Doubt is worrying about what might not. It is up to you to be in that state of love and choose it rather than be a victim of the other three. Do you choose to be a victim? Or do you choose to be a creator/lover? It’s that simple - that you see every choice you make as those choices. You are either creating your life with confident love, or allowing others to create your reality for you because you may feel like a powerless victim.

-Living in the “now” moment/the present.
Being clear of anger, fear or doubt. (When you recognize these 3 main feelings that are blocking you, you can be happy because now you know where you are stuck. Realize none of these are happening in the NOW. ) -Know that the majority of what you think about is not actually happening now, so enjoy the present. If the present is an unhappy one, it can and will change. It is temporary and fleeting.
Know yourself. Take time to spend alone to really get to the core of what your heart's desire is and what your core values are, without pressure of time, money or influence of others. Allow yourself to be more of who YOU truly are. In result, you will attract things to you more effortlessly because you are in your natural flow, your natural state of being, more naturally YOU.

-STAY AWAKE to your dream. Nothing like a cold slap in the face to remind you what your passion, desires and values are. When you fall off track, get too comfortable and stop growing, learning and living in our passion, your desired state of being, life will get your attention with a very big CONTRAST to your current focus. The more you ignore the realization and reality of yourself, the more uncomfortable that lesson and awareness awakening will be. Stay on track with your heart, values and desire and life will be easier! Connect to YOU, what you love to do and how you can do more of it. Make a top 10 list of “desirable states of being” (flowing, abundant, happy, etc.) and stick to it.

-Determination.
Don't give up on yourself or your dreams. Determination is what will carry you through to the end. Rather than being in a state of hope, wishing or wanting - be determined. Rather than speak about what you wish, want and aspire to, speak from a place of “I am going to, I am doing, I am living this, I am being this, I choose, I love” etc. 
The majority of people who are happy and successful in life know that when they set goals and take that first step towards their dreams and desires, they don't expect immediate results, and they expect failures and challenges along the way. But, they are determined to keep moving closer to their dream. They aren't afraid to say no to things that are not aligned with their integrity and values for fear of loss of success or loss of love.

-Respect yourself.
Ask for what you need and be vulnerable, humble and transparent enough to do so.
Do not allow others to harm you repeatedly. Have clear boundaries, voice them and follow through on those promises to yourself to respect yourself. Make a list of how to respect yourself and make it so! Keep good friends that will support you in respecting yourself and your needs.

-Self-care of your body, health, mind and spirit is important for a happy life. Focus on taking good care of yourself. Eat healthy, get outside and enjoy the fresh air, exercise, get plenty of sleep and go easy on yourself when things don't go well. 

-Take nothing personally.
Realize that what others say to you or about you speaks volumes about them and how happy or unhappy they are. If someone speaks bad about you or someone else, it's because they feel powerless or are unable to resolve or confront the issue at hand. To believe how someone acts towards you or what they do or say to you is all about you, is like believing their whole world and life has revolved around you. Their ""bad day"" or ""assholisms"" are not totally, or sometimes not even at all, about you. Their whole life has built up to this state of being in them. Step back witness, but don't invite or allow it into your state of being.

If you already have taken something personally, forgive them. Rather, forgiveness is even a judgment that they intentionally wronged you, so just chalk it up to their suffering that they could not fix, that they wanted to give away or needed help with and it was nothing personal about you. LET IT GO! Don't wait for an apology, because you will be the only one who suffers while you wait for it.

Find support and comfort in what is CONSTANT and not FLEETING. Here are some things that are Constants in life.
Nature – A walk in the woods or laying on the grass can change any mood. Did you know the health benefits of walking barefoot on the grass.. called Earthing? Were you aware that the negative ions found near a stream or mountaintop, magnetic field of the earth and the infrared ray of the sun were all put there to keep you happy, pain and stress-free? When was the last time you laid on the grass or walked barefoot outside? Try it!! It works well on headaches!

-God – The one you can always count on to ask for help, forgiveness, strength and more! Or whatever you believe in. The flying spaghetti monster also works.

-Connection – Connect with people, animals, children, birds, trees, communities, groups, teams, families like yours, friends far and near, and strangers. Just notice them, feel their inner happiness (no matter how small), their smile and just connect without words, or connect with a kind gesture.

-Love (found in the observation and appreciation of examples of the love you connect with, that inspires you, like sweet couples, tropical breezes on your skin, warm sun, flowers, a kind word, or performing kindness to someone else) Don't wait for it! BE IT! GROW IT!
Your consistency with your conscious choices! This not only means setting your values standard, sticking to it, saying no to old patterns, but it takes a little extra effort on your part. This could mean a daily ritual to line up with, invite, accept, feel and embody the greater parts of you that you know you are. (Rather than waking with stress and talking of your strife.) Daily connection, practice and tuning in to your desired state of being is important. Underneath all this illusion, you are that desired state of being already. You are that being. Uncovering this part of you, and being clear about what that is will open your body, aliveness and new doors more effortlessly. DO WHAT YOU LOVE & BE IT CONSISTENTLY!

To say further, DREAM A BETTER DREAM! If you don't like your experience or how you feel, then change it. There is always going to be bad and good to focus on. You get to choose which one you want to spend the most time thinking about and feeling. 

“Feelings are powerful, use them to your advantage. 
Feel, feel, feel and vibes of passion and success will wash over you.”

Loving others means:

-Having compassion for their journey.
Love their humanness. We all have hurts, challenges and curve balls thrown at us. We are doing our best to figure out this world. We've all done our best and our worst. This life does not come with an instruction manual. Appreciating their human journey allows you to step back and see the bigger picture and have compassion for them and how they act out of fear and survival mode.
Know that others treat you as someone has treated them before. It is learned and repeated. They will test you to be a part of their lesson and play. It is up to you if you want to play the other half of that role or not. Or you can choose to be a witness in the audience as they act out their healing process from their own pain. Have compassion for their suffering and their self-limiting beliefs, and open a space for love for them to step into with you.

-Don't judge them.
Who are we to know what is bad or good? Even in our own experience? Some of our worst of times, where we appeared helpless, and weak to others, was exactly what we need to go through to become who we are. We are all experiencing and expressing life in a very different way, to one path - Love. Give a little more love to those who may need a kind word or an open, non-judgmental friend to talk to. Judgment creates separateness, hatred and war. Small feelings can grow big; use the good ones and eliminate pollution in our universal mental pool.

-Having gratitude for their role in your life.
Often others are a hard reflection or teacher in our lives. Each one is a mirror for us to see where our weaknesses and self doubt are, and an opportunity to choose, to be bold and vulnerable enough to love ourselves, respect ourselves and take nothing personally. They represent a hard mirror for us to change what we see in that reflection. With this mirror, we can choose to just love ourselves and not be convinced by the ugly image they project onto that mirror. They test our level of reaction and attachment to things outside of ourselves. The less we react, the more enlightened and happy we become. We are like an open window, where things can pass through, but not stick. We are empty and free of attachments to outcomes, opinions and other fleeting experiences. We are free to be compassionate and unaffected by the outside world. We are empowered with love for ourselves and for others within.
Do no harm with your opinions or actions. It will only come back to you and hurt you in another way.

-Empowering them, not enabling or being a crutch. (Being of service without being a martyr.)
Knowing how to set healthy boundaries is an important part of having healthy relationships. When you are there to empower someone, you give them their power back. You do not carry the weight of their dependency on happiness and success. You offer tools, you give them ideas and share wisdom when asked. But offering all this without being asked will fall on deaf ears and be highly ineffective and under-appreciated. Be of service to them, without sacrificing yourself or your happiness. Now if you are like someone like Gandhi, you will enjoy serving others and sacrificing everything in order to serve them. Or if someone is sick and unable to take care of themselves, that is a different story. As long as you are not expecting anything in return from them, and it is true selfless service.

Hope this little bullet list was helpful y'all. Life is not always easy, but a little focus list like this can help keep you in check!

"Step Away Learn (193) We do our best. We step back. We breathe. We mend to whats needed from ourself. We then go full force. We take a step back.

**Self Awareness.** Its important to follow how **YOU** feel, not what someone is trying to tell you, not what someone else is projecting, but how **YOU** feel.

I now am beginning to learn how to follow how I feel; on days I feel tired after rising, I will now give myself more time and space to be. Its important for the balance of life, to do things for yourself daily. **To fill up your cup and be proud of that. No explaining, no convincing, just doing.**

People pleasing. **We all live with it, for someone.** I am unlearning, I am relearning, I am embracing. **Faith.**

**Everything is happening for the reason its suppose to.** 

**Divine. Keep going.**

"Let Go, Let the Universe (180) Its all out of our hands. We have control over **3 things and 3 things only.** Our thoughts, our actions and our intentions, the rest is none of our business.

With the highs and lows of each day, with the constant sense of, what is this for? It doesn't matter. The Universe wants you to win, to be at peace, to live in abundance; **we have to put an enormous amount of work in though. It won't come easy, but it will be worth it.**

Today is the beginning of your start, today is the beginning of your life. As is each day because everyday we rise, **is a blessing.** 

Don't take it for granted, **put your all into it; then do it again tomorrow, then the day after and so on, with passion and love.**

Fred Paul, at 84, and Florence Harvey, at 81, once again found the love they thought they had lost forever. Fred and Florence had been high school sweethearts lo these many years ago in the small town of Wandsworth, Canada. After high school, Fred left for a job in Toronto. When he came back a year later, Florence no longer lived in Wandsworth and Fred couldn’t find her. Each of them went on to have good marriages with others.

"Self Awareness is Vulnerabilities Strength (135) When we are vulnerable it can make us feel small, but through embracing and facing what makes us feel small, **thats when we grow into something greater than ourself.** 

Vulnerability used to be something that I used to avoid. Thinking that eventually it will ""change"". Learning that our truths are always going to be different than someone else truths, focusing on our own is important for happiness, peace, self love & to be one with who we are. **It all takes time.**

In this moment, what is it thats making you feel anxious? What is it that is making you feel vulnerable? Sit in those emotions. Push them away. With time, **it will all come to the surface.**

**I have learned that everything comes to the surface eventually, when we are ready, but constantly reminding myself that when facing a brand new situation through vulnerability, there will always be feelings of anxiety and fear & that is totally normal, we are human.**

**I love you.**

"The Change comes From Inside (134) We think that change comes from outside, that change comes from the external world. I have learned that change comes from inside, that change comes with intention and time.

In the past year, I have gone through many changes of my life, from healing from a heartbreak, to healing from drug abuse, to then acknowledging my trans identity. Change comes from inside. **Change comes when we put the work in daily.** Step by step, moment by moment, we can change everything we have lived with until this present moment and embrace the comfort zones being pushed, the vulnerable feelings, the anxiety, imposter syndrome and say **THIS IS GREATER THAN ME.**

Its difficult sometimes to see, why everything is happening for why its happening, **right now, but leading with Faith and hard work will show you why it was all meant to happen the way it did.** 

Once it happens, **it will all make sense but we don't need to try and figure it out how its going to happen.**

**Keep doing your best today.** 

**I love you.**

"Too busy to meditate? If getting into a routine is difficult, try stopping for a breath each time you take out your phone Mindfulness is all about applying 100% of your attention to whatever you’re doing. Of course this can be sitting down for a  guided meditation, focusing on our breath, or words/images, or your body. Doing a little of that kind of formal practice each day is the best way to see the full benefits of mindfulness but sometimes when we've got a lot on it can be hard to stay in a routine.

It's worth bearing in mind that the other way to develop your practice is simply being present in your everyday life. Its good to have things that you do regularly that can remind you to focus your awareness, sometimes called a bell of mindfulness. Examples of these are brushing your teeth in the morning, or walking to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. It can be as simple as something you see - everytime your take your phone out to take a look at it you can stop, focus on your inbreath, then focus on your outbreath. Returning to your breath several times a day helps to ground you in the present moment and reduce stress.

For me, the challenge is eating mindfully. I have a habit of mindlessly shoveling my lunch into my face and the hungrier I am the less mindful I become. But it's a really nice practice for the first few mouthfuls to take your time and fully experience what you’re consuming, what it looks like, smells like, the texture, the flavours. Eating slowly and mindfully in this way means we enjoy what we eat, we’re grateful for what we have and we appreciate what went into its creation. I find that it makes meals more filling as well so I tend to snack less afterwards.

Of course it's worth remembering the old adage ""You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day. Unless you're too busy, then you should sit for an hour."" Nothing is more important than your peace, so prioritise taking some time to be still when things are hectic. But making a bit of stillness part of your everyday life can a big difference.

"Best you can Do (90) The best we can do is that in itself. There is nothing more and nothing less, but remember though doing our best everyday isn't us giving it 10/10 & 150% energy. Some days our best is going to be 6/10 with 100% energy, some days 4/10 with 100% energy, some days 8/10 with 100%, doing our best will look differently everyday.

When we begin a journey, path, a focus that is different from the Social Quo, its about learning what works for us and what doesn't, & again, what ""doesn't work"" isn't a negative thing. Its about learning from the action and pivoting for the next time. It is all meant for our growth and all meant for us to improve whatever it is we are focusing on.

Trying new things, tasting new things is the most important thing to me. I truly believe we all need to be doing this constantly, realistically we have no idea what will stand out, what we might think might be for us but really isn't, what needs more time for space away from etc. We are constantly growing up (growing up is constant through all ages 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's). There is no limit to growth, **GROWTH** is limitless. Through the world we have grown up in, we presume that life is linear, that growth is linear, that our craft is linear, that our business is linear, that our mental health is linear, that our healing is linear and this is 100% **FALSE.**

Life is radical and forever will be. Even if you are content with working in a ""9-5"" culture, even that is radical. Everyday will look different, yes you might be doing the same tasks everyday but maybe you are not?

As I first stated, I think its such a wonderful and beautiful gift we have all been given to be able to try, taste and learn from 1000's and 1000's different things. We really only have a short amount of time on this planet so why waste it doing something that you don't like doing? Of course though when you are starting a new path, you still need to financially support yourself, which is where, grocery jobs, mcdonald's, office jobs, etc., comes into play, but using the time we have to do as much as we can towards those goals.

Today: Listen to my new podcast ""Watching Thoughts"" on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or Anchor. I speak about the ways to combat against thoughts that are trying to become thoughts; anxiety, depression, mental health, negative self talk etc., and let me know your takeaways from it after listening. I wish you well.

**I love you.**

"I’m so lucky. This post seems like nothing compared to all the other posts here since it’s different, but I didn’t know where to post it and it makes me so happy so I just wanted to post about it somewhere. Someone hated on me by calling me a name on a comment, and my boyfriend responded..

“For you to disrespect a girl who I am very close to by calling her a name is disgusting and I would never stand by and let anyone talk about someone I am close to like that. You don’t even know her so how can you even comment? It’s okay... she’s a strong girl with thick skin and friends who will do anything for her and your comments won’t phase her but you might want to think before you speak because you’re the one who has to live with the hate you spread.” 

Idk that just warmed my heart and made me feel so special, loved, and cared for which is amazing because I don’t feel that way often. I’m so thankful to have someone like him in my life, I don’t know what I did to deserve him. He makes me feel so important and happy.  Some people might be like “He’s your boyfriend, he’s supposed to do that” and I know that but I’m just not used to being loved and the way he worded it was so adorable.

"Positive Words & Habits Happy People Use Hi,

as an counselor  I sometimes have to dig much deeper into the psychology of my clients for them to find balance and happiness in life.

"I can't believe what I've pulled off When I was in 6th grade, I took a class called Keyboard. In this class, we learn music theory and how to play the piano, except the school can't afford a bunch of pianos, so we have keyboards instead.

I was super excited for this course. I love music. I've been taking lessons for 7 years now. The year I took keyboard was my 6th. 

6th grade was the first year of middle school. When I went on ""fifth-grade orientation"" to tour the place, we went to keyboard and I asked the teacher there if it was a beginner class. She said no. 

She lied to me. But I couldn't explain my feelings of fury, because she retired the next year, so I never had her. Instead, I had Mr. C.

He was the most fun teacher I've ever had. He really understood middle schoolers. We played kahoot, we did a beanbag throwing game to learn the notes of the staff.

But I couldn't grasp that when I was there. I was bitter the whole year because I was stuck in a beginner class when I had learned all of the stuff he taught in 1st grade. He gave me more challenging pieces than the rest to work on while we were working on songs, but I still had to sit through classes about the notes of the staff and the note values and other boring stuff that I knew since forever.

Also, this kid in my class named Caiden kept making fun of me because I was a ""teacher's pet."" It's not my fault I'm better than you, I'd say if this happened now. But I couldn't take it back then.

So because the class was too easy and Caiden was being himself, I transferred to Chorus for 7th grade. But I hate it so much. The class is boring AF. All we do is sing the same shitty songs over and over again. And 4 kids in my class were making fun of me FOR SINGING IN CHORUS CLASS. For a huge part of the year, I regretted even coming.

My friends Sana and Niko, who were both in my class last year, both fill me in on what's happening without me. My friend Holly is in 6th grade and she is also musically inclined, she takes voice lessons at the same place where I take piano. But she's not leaving, so she gets what I don't.

Last Thursday, 6/6, I went to the bathroom in the middle of chorus to get away from it. I had just finished my chorus final, on the same stuff I learned in Keyboard last year and in piano lessons in 1st grade, and I had a bit of a headache, so I yeeted outta there. In the bathroom, I see 4 out of the 6 girls there. They tell me that Mr. C is going to teach 6th-grade band next year. 

This week is the last day of school. I realize how good of a teacher Mr. C really was. He didn't have to try to challenge me. He really didn't. But he tried anyway. He was the best teacher I've ever had, the only one that really cared about me.

So I decide, ""I'm going to make him a card, and get all of his students to sign it.""

Niko agreed to get his class to sign it right away, P5.

Sana took a little more influencing, but she agreed to do P4.

I tried to get Holly, who was P7, to pass it down to P6 since the 2 periods were back to back. (7 comes before 6 since we have flip days at school where it's 1 2 3 7 6 5 4 on Tuesdays and Thursdays). But she refused. So I told her to just get her class, but to meet me in the stairwell before her lunch period (I have a math class downstairs my P7, her lunch period).

The 8th-grade classes don't participate because they have graduation

But she never shows up. I have to go to math. But then I tell my teacher I'm going to the bathroom at the end of the 6th grade lunch period, and I go there instead. I find Holly and tell her to do her class, and I tell her that I'll find her after my lunch period since that's when her class ends.

Her class signs it. I fist-pump. I ask her if there's a P6 keyboard class today, but they had PE. I thought I was doomed. I wouldn't be able to get that class. 

But then I see my friend Josh in 6th grade, who I met in art club, to get all the keyboard people in his keyboard class to sign it. He agrees to do it. I go to Spanish, which is upstairs.

Niko and I have Spanish together, and at the end of the period, we run down to PE to find that kid. He gives us the card back, and I give it to Niko to get his class to sign it. From there it's all smooth sailing. I go to art on the other side of the building. Then I come for Chorus and Sana for Keyboard. Niko and I make the exchange, I sign it, and give it to Sana. She does the final period.

Then we give it to Mr. Cyr. He hugs me and Sana since we present it to him. I can't believe we succeeded. It took so much work, but we succeeded.

I'm at home right now. I think to myself that if I had him this year, I wouldn't have done this for him. I would still be bitter. Because of chorus, I learned that ""you only know someone when you let them go.""

And now I feel happy with myself. I've changed a lot since the day I walked into his class for the first time, but that's okay. I'm fine with that. I'm happy for the first time since Chorus.",excited,Happiness
"How many times? How many times have you been in love?  
  
Twice.   
At 40 years old I have been in love 2 times.   
It happened once when I was 18, and again when I was 31.  
  
Sure. There have been many connections, lots of long term infatuations... But love? The kind where I'd do anything for that person in my life, the kind where there is this immediate electricity that is palpable when the two of your hands make contact with one another.... The kind that never goes away. No matter what you do. Whether you do the leaving, they do the leaving, or life does the splitting.... The two souls can never again live peacefully unaware of the others existence.   
  
It's happened twice though.   
Something I previously believed could not happen twice.   
  
If it happened twice, could it happen again?   
  
If it happened again, would I run this time? Or would I be compelled to stay even after all I've seen. After what I know can happen. What I know is likely..... What would I do then? Sometimes the universe is too much for me to comprehend. Sometimes I think my heart will burst from the happiness, or the pain, or both....   
  
Then I remember to just. Be. Still. And know.   
  
Then everything is ok again.",excited,Happiness

"My thoughts on happiness So I was on Instagram and someone I know posted a text picture saying, “is there really a thing called true happiness or are happy people just insensitive to life?” That really made me think, because I really try and always make the best of everything, and I am a genuinely happy person, but that doesn’t make me insensitive to life. 
Happiness is like not a thing that’s there forever, it’s a feeling. Feelings come and go just like literally everything else lol. When a time comes that we have things to be thankful of that give us joy or situations that do, then we should do everything in our power to be happy about them in that moment and in every moment that it’s possible. We can not let the pain of the past and certainly not the non existent pain of the future steal away our happy moments. That’s not insensitivity, it’s the opposite of grateful. 
I want to live a life where I find every opportunity I can to find things to be grateful for. And appreciate all that I have instead of victimising myself because of all I have lost.

"What are the little things that bring you joy? Sometimes we spend so much time on looking for big, big events/changes/things to make us happy that we forget about the tiny little things that sprinkle just a little bit of joy on your day. What are the little tiny details in your day/life that make you happy?

Here are mine:

* Trying different flavors of coffee creamer in my morning cup of half-caff. I'm not a big coffee person, but I love having a cup of half-caff for my morning boost. I just bought peppermint mocha creamer and it's so comforting and refreshing. It reminds me of Christmas! My morning coffee is a warm and sweet cup of joy!
* My favorite bath towel! I don't like towels that are too soft, and I don't like small towels. My current favorite towel is just right! Not too soft but not too rough, and big enough to dry me off and keep me covered. I've had this towel for over 5 years and I'm afraid to replace it. (Don't worry, I wash it every week! XD)
* Being at a farmer's market. I have a little local farmers market close to home, so I walk to it on Saturdays and buy some goods for the week. The fishmonger is friendly and helpful, the fruits and veggies look tasty all piled together, and the food from the taco stand smells so good! I also like shopping here because I like to pretend in my head that I'm in the middle ages shopping at a market. \^\_\^
* Libraries. I just like that libraries exist. I like walking around in them and browsing the books. It's quiet and full of knowledge and entertainment.

"What ends well.. Today was a horrible day. Right from the beginning, I was late to my class, to the end, my head was, and still is, pounding like a jackhammer. All in all, it was going horribly. Until now. 
So my roommate ordered some food but wasn't there when the delivery guy finally arrived so I had to go pick it up. He was incredibly sweet inspite of the fact that he had to wait for some time before she got the money. So while leaving I asked him to keep the change (not something we normally do in my country) and he was so happy! It was the brightest smile I'd seen in days, months even! My head is still pounding, but hey, thinking about him smile makes me feel better. Amazing how one unexpected little thing can make your mood turn around a 180°

"gratitude = happiness About five years ago I started regularly writing things I was grateful for in a journal.

I would write simple things that I was grateful for like waking up to the sun, all the way to specific/detailed things like the person's smile I encountered on a walk during the day which also made me smile.

I do this daily, and it's an instant way to set up my day to be in a good place. Before bed also is great as it sets up my subconscious to recognize the amazing things in life. 

and from this experience, I created a fun little weekend project to help enhance my gratitude practice and I would love some beta users to try it out if anyone is interested!

When I started creating 3 years ago, I started by taking photos on my iPhone of buildings, cars, streets etc. With time I got bored and pivoted to then taking portraits of other people. Working with brands, stylists, makeup artists etc; then started painting and have been trying new things ever since.

**Self Awareness.** Its the root of knowing when its time to pivot away from what was once a strong passion but now trying to find motivation to continue to focus on it. Its ok to change routes because in the bigger picture, this is apart of your route. 

Taking a step back, changing routines, changing habits will lead you to leapfrog forward. Its ok to not know what you are going to do for ""life"", **keep trying and tasting, until you do and know that even when finding it, that it can change as well, in time.**

"Focus on You (92) Focus on you Today. I know its easy to look at EVERYONE else and what EVERYONE else is doing but will that allow you to heal? Will that allow you to progress with yourself, with your mental health, with your depression, with your goals etc.?

Don't get me wrong, I am **ALL** about celebrating, supporting and being there for others but its very important to remember that everyday we only have a certain amount of marbles in the jar. If we are giving those marbles away constantly, how are we going to have any energy for ourselves, for our needs and for our boundaries? **We won't.**

Some ways that help me focus on myself daily, is through stretching, meditation, being outside for at least 30 minutes, playing video games, watching videos on youtube that are related with my niche and focus, reading, painting, etc. Find what works for you and keep focusing on that, little by little, day by day.

Something that I used to struggle with was wanting ""success"" fast and obsessing over the destination rather than enjoying the journey. The journey and the process is what is most important for **EVERYTHING** we are focusing on.

If we are doing our best we can do, and like my blog focus was about a few days ago, that doesn't mean giving 10/10 but giving the energy we have for the day to the best of our ability, into whatever we are passionate about.

**Today:** Give yourself a hug, the battle has been long, its been tough but **YOU** have made it through it all and I am so fucking proud of you. Keep pushing.

Outside of big future plans like"" okay I need a job so I will look for jobs online"" or doing my part-time job, I just don't know what to do with myself. I get so uninspired and upset by this. I want to have fun and be happy but then I just don't know how to or what to do. Then I see my friends or just other people hanging out with people or doing good things etc and I feel jealous and that my life and existence is inferior. I just don't know what to do on these days of being uninspired and I then try too hard to be something or do something and that makes it feel worse.

"Power in Fear (83) Fear. It can easily consume our minds and body. Fear, over financial, food, our business, our safety, our health etc., there are many things that fear can try and consume and overwhelm us with. 

**WE MUST BE CONSCIOUS AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO CONNECT WITH THE EXTERNAL & OUT OF OUR PERSONAL SELF. Connecting with God, Jesus, Higher Power, the Universe, Source, Divine Energy etc., you name it.**

Fear has always been a problem with me, fear of someone else's opinion, fear of my safety, fear of how I will make it through; anxiety, depression and many things that can be connected to fear, until I started **meditating daily**, until I started **praying daily**, **writing gratitude lists daily**, **being in nature daily;** the **divine** energy that I was given and now am given **daily,** has now allowed me to be in touch with myself, (remember I am still **learning**, I am still **healing**, I am still **struggling)** that it now has allowed me to be in touch with my **identity,** stopped the need for excessive self induced numbing and began to see the world as God and Jesus has intended for me, through **Love** & **Light**, rather than *fear & illusion.*

It all takes time and I am grateful for it. Grateful for the pains, the sadness, the hardships, the anxiety attacks, the depression and everything in between that has now led me to creating my story. **WE ALL HAVE STORIES.** We must keep doing our best everyday until, **we are ready to speak, or share through many different ways of mediums.**

Starting each day with an open mind, starting each day with knowing that today will be better than yesterday and releasing the fact of thinking what will happen tomorrow, we can constantly connect and live solely in the **present.** The **present** is where the **happiness** is. The **present** is where the **peace** is. The **present** is where the **healing** is. Its difficult to live in the present and then still have the same mindset that we will continue to live for another 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years etc., but **we can do it.** With day to day practice and connection with the energy that is external from us.

**Today:** Try something new. Try something that you have been wanting to for the past little while. Try something that is causing fear or anxiety on your life. Try something that even if you don't know, deep down you know its the right step for you; starting a business, writing poetry, making art, having a conversation with someone etc., thats up to you to decide what to do but I know and **I believe in you**, that you will get it done.

**I love you.**

"I Will Never Be Happy - 5 Mistakes That Are Killing Your Happiness I will never be happy.

If that’s your mantra, you need to meet Mr. Butler. He’s a character in a novel *Martin Eden* by Jack London. He ended up realizing, “I sacrificed everything for money and now I will never be happy.”

I want to break down his mistakes to help you become happier.

And if you're not into reading long posts, I also made an audio. You can check it out [here](https://romanmironov.com/blog/i-will-never-be-happy/).

## Butler’s story

Charles Butler went to work at a young age. He worked in the daytime and studied at night. He began as an office boy at a law firm and quickly progressed to a clerk and then junior partner.

He was ambitious. Butler denied himself any enjoyment in life and saved money. Soon, he was rich. 

He reached his goal but was he happy?

## Mistake 1: He sacrificed happiness for his goal

*“Layin' up money, workin' all day an' studyin' all night, just workin' an' never playin', never havin' a good time, an' never learnin' how to have a good time--of course his thirty thousand came along too late.”*

Butler wired himself to be happy only when he got his goal. And in the process of getting there, he lost something important: his ability to enjoy life.

*“An' I bet that he's solemn an' serious as an old owl, an' doesn't care a rap for a good time, for all his thirty thousand a year.”*

He thought money would make him happy and felt jealous of rich people. But then he got rich and felt jealous of happy people.

*“An' I'll bet he's not particularly joyful at seein' others have a good time.”*

## Mistake 2: He focused on making money

*“He could not find an adequate motive in Butler's life of pinching and privation. Had he done it for love of a woman, or for attainment of beauty, Martin would have understood.”*

Butler made a false assumption that money would make him happy. And he failed miserably. Money does provide comfort but not necessarily happiness. He should’ve focused on being happy rather than making money. Focusing on doing what he loved and service to other people. Then he would’ve been happy. And he would’ve also made money because he would’ve been naturally good at doing what he loved.

## Mistake 3: He ruined his health

Butler’s dyspepsia is a perfect metaphor for how we already have what we need to be happy. He had his health and ability to enjoy life but thought that wasn’t enough. And when he got rich, he couldn’t enjoy it because of dyspepsia. At that point, he realized that he should’ve been happy when he still had had his health.

## Mistake 4: He was stingy

Butler was too economical. And he pushed himself into a scarcity mindset. He held onto his money even when he became rich. What’s the point of being rich if he wired himself not to be able to spend it?

## Mistake 5: He missed his golden years

*“Why, thirty thousand, lump sum, wouldn't buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin' up would have bought him, when he was a kid, in the way of candy an' peanuts.”*

Kids can be 100% present in the now wherein lies our happiness. Butler didn’t make use of those golden years. He never learned to be playful in life. He taught himself to be serious. And that’s a state that makes it hard to be happy.

## One actionable tip

*""I feel sorry for Butler. He was too young to know better, but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty thousand a year that's clean wasted upon him.”*

Don’t be Mr. Butler so that you end up saying, “I will never be happy.”

Be Martin Eden. He pursued his passion and loved passionately. He had fun all the time. He enjoyed his money by spending it and giving away happily.

A life coach Tomas Svitorka said:

“20s should be years of experimenting and exploring what you love and what you want in life. As soon as you find it, buckle down and pursue it with all you have. With that said, don’t miss out on life entirely. There are things you won’t be able to do later. Always pursue fulfilment.”

"The happiness of poverty (?) I have lived around poor people for much of my life, in Africa, South America and in the US. I have zero doubt that they are happier places than in more affluent places. My belief is that there is something in accepting your life, the way it is, with little chance of ever rising above. When you always believe that there is something better -always out of reach, it kills something in your spirit. The saying ""envy is the thief of happiness"", applies, because aren't we, in fact envying the life we think we should have, rather than the one we have? Envy is the legacy of modernity. We want the wife more beautiful than the one we have, we want the bodies we don't have, the salaries others get. So, was it even right to introduce undiscovered tribes to sneakers, candy and radios? Were their lives really improved by having access to the larger world and the mountains of possessions that rule it?",excited,Happiness

Bob Harvey and Annette Callahan, both 80, married 63 years after the high-school sweethearts broke up. Before you get your hanky out, Annette simply met someone during her summer vacation out of state (this was back when we had 3 month long summer breaks), who became her husband. Bob also married soon after, and both report long and happy marriages. But neither Annette nor Bob ever forgot about the other, and a few years after each became widowed, they used social media to find their high-school “steady” - without knowing the other was searching too.

"Is it ever ""wrong"" to be happy? I had been training to do the splits at the gym for some months, and had almost got it.

Yesterday, one if my pet snakes suddenly died. She was completely fine the day before and suddenly died. I do not know what happened, and I felt very sad, and felt guilty because what if I could have done something to save her. But really there is nothing I can do about it now.

Today I went to the gym feeling depressed. Finally, today I achieved the goal of doing the full splits. I felt very happy and sent pics of me doing it to my friends. 

I got home, and remembered about the snake, and it feels wrong to be happy now.

"Stop obsessing over new habit that don’t make you happy 
No one talks about ""not"" creating new habits. We waste so much mental energy and self-worth over failing on new habits that don't make us happy.


I've been a victim of this.
 
Once I attempted to practice badminton every day to stay fit. I had a racket at home and court was close by, so it [seemed] like a good idea. However, the visit was on and off and I never succeeded in sustaining it. Most importantly, I wasn't really happy with it nor did I find the visit meaningful.


About 2 weeks ago, I tried again. But this time, it'd be 30 min of basketball, 3 times a week with my wife. Basketball is my favourite sport and I wanted to spend quality time with my wife. Surprise, surprise… I haven't missed a single day.
 

Spending quality time with her is the most important thing to me. Because unfortunately, we, as in people don't have plenty of time with our loved ones.


I've been ""using"" my wife to create new habits for two weeks now.

 •Learn to code while she learns English (quality time together in the same room
 •Cook once a week for her (learn to cook and spend quality time)

 You get the point.

The key to sustaining a habit: Do things that make you truly happy. Not what others think it'll make you happy.


So stop and think for a moment. Do you care about this new habit you're trying? If you do, what kind of life long meaning is there? If you want to clean your room, invite your friends or family over the next weekend.
 
I think discovering small habits that make you feel wholesome is the key to cultivating a new you. I'm involved in a neuroscience project and community in progress to develop a more detailed approach. Check out [here](reddit.com/r/newbrain).

"it's MY time. I'm so ready to move. Anywhere and everywhere! I'm filled with peace, and I'm finally ready. I'm ready to do the next, big, scary thing in life. I've learned so very much about who I am, and what I am no longer. I've come to know my own boundaries. I've discovered how to assert them both kindly, and strongly, at the same time. I've learned how to catch myself hiding- from fear, from love, from success, from people, from insecurity, from doing the right thing, the difficult thing... From myself.   
  
I've learned to find my safety from within... I'm dealing with the reality that everything has a price. There are no heroes, no shortcuts, no safe places, no excuses, no time, and no feeling that is ever experienced purely, to the exclusion of all other thoughts and emotions. There is always balance, even when I get stuck in moments of unpleasant extremes.... I've learned that if I can find the strength to breathe through it, the other side of that pain holds an unimaginable payoff.  
  
Faith. It's a real thing. It's not what I was told it was my whole life- the belief that there is some great power which is looking out for my best interest, and has some sort of ultimate plan for me, that my current situation is a part of. I believe the true definition of faith is to know that I cannot control what is outside of myself, but i can know, that whatever it is, I'll be able to handle it. This is so much more empowering to me. And I do know I can. I believed I'd die. I believed life wasn't worth living anymore. I believed that IF I ever was happy again, it was to be a very long, and very excruciating, time from that moment. But a little voice inside of me *knew* that those beliefs were false. Lies. *That* was faith, and it was *right*.   
  
Such a short time later. . ... Life is *not* perfect, but I. AM. *Happy*. It's amazing. I'm so grateful that life went the way it did. So happy that it worked out in a way that put me right here. Right where I'm standing today. My God, I can't imagine how much worse off I'd be right now if things had gone the way *I* wanted them to go!! Today I have my mind back, my body is mine again, my heart is so open and full of joy, and acceptance, and love, it feels like it could burst.   
  
Yes, I have bad days. But they never last. I know it's time to go on that next terrifying adventure. It's time to be brave. It's time to come out of hiding. Fuck you world, *bring it!* I'm ready, I'm willing, I'm strong, I'm happy, and *you can't break me.*   
  
  
Time is a bitch. I only get as much as I get. No more sitting around waiting for the decision to he made for me. This is *my* life. It's *my* time, and no one is ever allowed to disrespect it ever again. Least of all me.",excited,Happiness

"Unpopular I'm unpopular here. On Reddit. I don't mind. I don't come here for friends. I don't come here for approval. I actually come here to journal. I find that my thoughts are put down more completely, and are more concise if I have an audience. Then, later, I can read through them with ease, and understanding. Sure, I know it's possible that people I'd rather not know my business could read it. But I don't care. It's my truth, and it's a practice in honesty for me. I used to think I was soooo honest!! HA! I was fooling myself most of all, and what a shit storm I created with my lies.   
  
Denial- the worst kind of lie is the one you tell yourself. So, you see, if my truth is unpopular, it only shows me why I was afraid to tell it in the first place. It also shows me that it's not really so bad to tell it. I see the bliss on the other side of fear now, and that is to say that I don't really notice the people who don't like my truth. I only see the ones who accept, and love me despite it. Truth weeds out the crap real fast, and it's so simple.  
  
As far as my real life goes, I don't want to tell people what they want to hear anymore. Only what they need to know. If I can communicate- truly get another to understand me- with kindness and empathy, I've succeeded beyond my greatest ambitions. That to me is a success of the highest order- a personal success. One that makes me believe in myself, and like myself more because of it. To me, self love is the pinnacle of happiness.",excited,Happiness

"Has today been a day of happiness for you?  

I can say with all honesty just over a year ago I was not in a good place. Call it mid life crisis or just stuck in a rut I found myself stressed and unhappy on a daily basis. There are many reasons why I should have been happy, I have a lovely wife, two great boys and a loving home but something just wasn't right, something was missing. Life just didn't feel in balance and in harmony to where I desired to be.

I'm confident there are many others out there who have felt or are feeling like this right now.

On reflection today has been a happy day for me for which I am truly grateful. Hoping this doesn't sound religiously oriented the past year or so has been one of an awakening and an awesome journey inward. I have given myself time to get to know me and can say with all honesty I'm in a much happier place. I'm not stressed anymore and I'm happy and confident in any and all situations. I'm still on my journey and will be for the rest of my life however the path I'm walking now is truly a great one and I wanted to share this on this international day of Happiness.

I sincerely hope with all my heart that everyone is feeling happy today!!! If I can leave you with a parting gesture:-

Pull themselves out of poverty and build a solid future.

What does cost something is giving the ability to share knowledge.

"I love this feeling! Be happy for me!!! Start of with some backstory. I was married and with the same person for 11 years we practically grow up together than a day happened where she was done something else caught her eye and I was let go. That's the long story short it just happened like that I was alone and single with know one to fill the is bond that just left me. I stayed that way finding happiness in things that I knew couldn't quit me cause they were what I did to make me feel happy again. Running than biking than swimming than triathlons. It filled the void .
From the age of about 25 to 30 no dates zero me and my dog we're lone wolfs in a 2 man wolf pack. I did social outings had conversations with girls but never tried to grab there attention. I was doing my thing. A man who I had been training with to accomplish an iron man essentially set me up with his daughter whom I found out I work with well kinda work with who I've always admired cause she's quiet and to the point. We had a lunch date today and she blow me out of the water.
She could tell I was uncomfortable but not for the wrong reason and she knew I was out of my element and flat out said look i feel the tension on you and it's ok. Your friends actually told alot about me and I can't believe you're done with relationships. She took my hand first date mind you and said hey I want to get to know you cause I really really like you and think your a super cool dude and I want some of that in my life.
Uncontrollably I cried not weeping but tears rolled down my fave I wanted to leave so bad but cause it was embarrassing and all I could say without thinking was I'm tired of being alone. Like I've been hiding something from myself for years not realizing what I was doing. It was an out of this world experience. I've never felt in many in my life till than. She laughed and said it's ok I know you more than you think . I was like my friends are assholes what do they tell you. And she said everything even things you didn't see. She reassured me and the whole time I was thinking I blew it can never show my face again I'm done for.
We talked a bit more and went our separate ways. Went home sat on the floor with my dog who is named Dogmeat not important but I love her name .just thought to myself maybe something is wrong. Than I get a text from her saying we're going out Friday pick me up at 7 please. 
Than it dawned on me did I just meet a genuine person some one who is into me cause of what she heard about me . Not just physical appearance but actual facts of who I am as a person. I went from feeling scared to worried than to happy. I was happy I felt happy not accomplished but happy. A feeling that I though I had was there and made me feel so heavy in the chest. That's why I cried and embarrassed myself I was happy. Even if this doesn't work that feeling that hurt that worry it's worth it people . I want everyone to experience it . I still can't describe it but it's amazing. Have I been depressed for this long was I broken at the core . Emotions are healthy use them I needed to share I'm a 30 year old firefighter who works in a very aggro atmosphere shes an ER nurse who sees us at our worst .all the time.

"Moving Forward & Going (199) We take time for ourself. I am learning to. First time ever. To just be. **Be one with the Earth, rather than working against it.**

We learn, we try our best again, we take a step back, we get launched forward, we keep moving. Life is about steady changes by living in the present, living now, and now and now. 

Every second moving but do we follow or are we going with it? **Does waiting for the next experience to occur rather than being in this one right now, deter us from what we are truly meant to do?**

I am learning, I am unlearning, I am sharing, I am embracing........**Faith.**

**Give the time your soul needs; your spirit needs, your body needs.** I have learned that if we don't take a break when our body is desperately wanting us to, that our body **will do it for us eventually.** 

Give yourself a break. **Its ok.**

"How to Track Your Happiness -- and the Happiness Tracker Spreadsheet For the last couple years, I have been on a journey to **test and tweak various methods to track and improve my own happiness**.   


At first this started off with asking ""What is the favorite part of your day?"" at the dinner table. Expressing more gratitude certainly helped.   


Then this lead to actually tracking my **Top 3 moments of the day** and writing them down in the notes app on my phone.   


Finally, I was listening to the Tim Ferriss Show's interview of Jim Collins. And turns out that **Jim has the perfect method for tracking happiness**. He gives each day a score and tracks that score over time. His scale is as follows.   


* 2 is a great day
* 1 is a good day
* 0 is a so-so day
* \-1 is a bad day
* \-2 is a really bad day

After using this system for the past few years, I can say that it works. **It helps me to better gage my happiness levels**, and focus on doing the things that make ME the happiest in my daily life. Is every day great? No. But I am starting to **improve my days simply by giving each day a score**.

"Alone(ly) (155) We are lonely, we are alone. Whats the difference? I am lonely on a journey of life that has been given to me, that has lead me to choose. I am not alone. I enjoy my space. I enjoy being with myself and connecting with my inner being rather than having to be around others constantly.

Through the time we have been given that as well as has been difficult, we can now know that even when we are with ourselves, that we can push through.

Through the times that force us to take a step back, thats when we are being given the opportunity to be propelled forward.

Life has been radical and a rollercoaster for me lately but through everything I am grateful for it. **Keep pushing.**

The times we are going through can be difficult sometimes to find the energy to push through the day, to complete tasks and projects that have been created by us but then become a responsibility. Something that helps me is knowing when I am feeling tired and wanting to give up, **I take a step back. To reset. I go outside and breathe in fresh air to forget about life for a brief moment and just be.**

Everything that is being focused on right now is for something greater than we can even think of, that we expect, but the Universe already knows and thats all that matters to me.

"Support Your Ground (122) We look to others, when we really we should focus on ourself. When starting something that is different from the people around us, the generations of a followed structured plan, etc., it will always be difficult but through the process and the journey is where we learn how to maneuver through.

**When we support ourselves, everything will work out with time. Divine timing & Patience.** 

Everyday is a chance for us to learn something new, to face something we never even knew we needed healing with or to do something for ourselves first, to heal a little bit more. With every rep, with every moment that we fill our cup up first, it will lead to then being there and helping out others, even more than if we did it the other way around.

For the past 23 years of my life up until 4 or so months ago I was always there for people but I had it confused. This was people pleasing, where I was projecting insecurity through the subconscious expectation that they would be there for me as well, when needed. Now, I unlearn and relearn to put myself first everyday. 1 step back, 2 steps forward, 2 steps back, 3 steps forward, 4 steps back, 5 steps forward etc. **Patience.** Self awareness is the beginning to healing. **Keep doing your best.**

"Do something that makes you nervous (112) Nervous ? Anxiety ? Do it anyway. If you don't, thats ok, the day will come where you can anyway. If you can push through whatever it is that trying to push you down, hold you back, in this moment, then it **DO IT,** but remember; fearlessness is not the fact of you not having any fear, but despite it,you still **PERSEVERE.**

Something that I get caught up in, is the thought of GETTING THERE, WANTING TO BE THERE, even though I enjoy the process, even though during the journey, that is where you learn everything, I still have to ground myself daily to know that all I have is **right here, right now**. **Give yourself time, give yourself space, it will come with time.**

When we are going through anxiety, when we are going through depression, lack of motivation, a spiritual awakening, anything that causes you to face the unknown there will always be a wave of emotions, of anxieties because of the unknown. This is all normal, there are positive anxieties and also there is negative anxieties. **Embrace how you are feeling and know that growth is on the way, healing is on the way and its happening as you feel that wave of unknown emotions.**

"Take a break from the news and social media; doomscrolling through negative stories impacts your mental health One of my less mindful habits is that I’m sometimes a bit of a news junkie - I’d happily sit in front of the news channel or scrolling through twitter when a big story is happening. This can be bad for our wellbeing though, particularly as the algorithm that controls our news feed is designed to provoke a reaction from us. Emotions like fear and anger are a lot more likely to grab people’s attention than happiness, so the content that we get fed through tends to water the seeds of anxiety and resentment.   

We can notice how much time we’re depending on the news and social media and limit ourselves, setting a regular alarm on our phone (the Plum Village app is good for this). When it goes off, if you’re watching the news or on social media, just stop, breath, notice your thoughts, notice what you’re feeling. With more awareness, you can make informed decisions about the media you consume and decide for yourself when to stop. 

But the evidence shows that with the news and social media, less is more. You can get a summary of whats going on once or twice a day - with the time you save you can call up a friend, go for a walk, enjoy nature. Its critical to be aware of what you consume, not just through your mouth but through your eyes and ears as well. The seeds we water create the garden we live in.

"G(r)o(w) Through It (88) Everyday. We start new. We rise in the early morning, in the late morning, in the early afternoon, maybe at 3pm, who knows. We all have different schedules. We all experience different pains, things that make us happy, sadness, anxieties, joys, depressions, etc. 

I have learned through the past few years that even if we push our emotions, our feelings, our anxieties, things that we know are meant for us down and down, they will still be there, waiting to come up to the surface. 

I remember when I was younger, in grade 9 at the age of 12, thinking oh my liking for all genders and identities ""will go away"", I will ""learn out of it"". I remember feeling the feelings of transness but having a lack of knowledge what it was that I could never connect with, what it was. I remember wanting to start my creative path and having anxiety to start. I remember wanting to move out and start a new chapter in a new city that caused fear. I remember the heartbreak. I remember the lack of self identity. I remember the numbing through alcohol and drugs. I remember it all. **I am grateful for it all.**

I am writing this all out and sharing things that have always been so deep inside, thinking ""oh I could never share this with anyone, this is too weird, I won't be accepted, appreciated, or even prosper in what I want to focus on by sharing my truth"". I am sharing all of this for you to know that **YOU ARE VALID.** That what **YOU** bring to this world is **authentic**, **unique**, **loving,** **1 of 1** and **to be honest with you**, **THE WORLD NEEDS IT.** We are all waiting for **YOU** to share, to create and focus on what it is you want to do. **WE NEED IT SO BADLY FROM YOU**, that I am writing this all, hoping to impact you to **START** or **CONTINUE** what you have already been doing.

Our time on this planet is limited. Our time on this planet is sacred. Our time can always be up, we never know. Our Creator knows. God knows. 

**I URGE YOU TO START TODAY. FOR YOU TO BE YOU.**

"If you've tried meditation and felt like giving up because you keep having thoughts - it's normal. Give yourself a chance: be still and observe the thoughts as they arise without being swept away If you’ve tried meditation a few times then you might have become frustrated. You’re sitting quietly, enjoying the silence, enjoying the stillness and a thought about work pops up, or you remember a difficult conversation you had. You might feel like you’re somehow doing it wrong or you can’t do meditation. 

It’s important to know that this is normal; noone can meditate without having thoughts. Your mind is constantly looking for things to resolve, it’s a problem-solving tool which has evolved to be on the constant lookout for danger, learn from mistakes and its very good at what it does. The challenge comes when the mind is overstimulated, over-active and is constantly processing potential dangers and trying to learn from things in the past. That fragmentation of our attention creates suffering and it’s not until we stop for moment that we realise how busy our minds actually are.

And thats the first step - to simply observe the mind. Notice the thoughts as they arrive, not judging them, not being carried away by them, just noticing what arises. You might imagine yourself sitting on a hill, seeing each thought as a cloud passing overhead and passing over the horizon. Another way to visualise it is sitting by a river and watching leaves float past. Just as we don’t try to stop or hold onto clouds as float past, we allow our thoughts to enter our awareness and then pass through.

So if you find that you’re having a lot of thoughts while meditating and you have to bring your attention back to your breath often that doesn’t mean that you’re doing it wrong - that’s the practice. Over time, training your awareness, you tend to find the thoughts come less often, they’re less intense and they cause less suffering. You spend more time in the present moment and feel calmer and more relaxed.

"Inside Ride (66) It takes time. Its about learning. Its about doing our best. That in itself is the most we can do. Everyone makes ""mistakes"". Everyone has moments that they act in, but reminisce on once that moment is over, we can't dwell and begin to regret our action, we must feel how we feel, watch our thoughts and move forward. Next time, do better. It will bug you, it will make you feel indifferent, it will allow you to feel uncomfortable, but remember thats where **Growth** is. 

Growth is always in the moments of hardships, pain, sadness, things that we don't expect but can not change since its already happened. I have had many moments that after I do something i'm like ""oh, I did that"", feeling embarrassed for a brief second, but knowing this is all for my highest purpose. Everything is for our highest selfs. It takes time and is always on Divine Timing. The way each of our paths and lives are different, unique, original. 2:22. Right place, right time.

Its snowing, its cold outside, the seasons have changed right before our eyes, we must stay focused. Focused on our mental health, our wellbeing, our crafts, our passions and our Divine Path. Life is about Trial and Learning, rather than what we have been conditioned to saying ""Trial and Error"", it is only an error if we do not learn from the action that we have done, next time.

"3 Simple habits to cope with negative self talk  

“I’m not good enough”, “I’m not smart”, “life is hard”, “I’m not loved”, “What if I fail?”, we all have those kind of voices in our head running constantly throughout our life.

The problem with them, is it’s impossible to stop them, no matter how you try, the more you do, the more they become stronger.

Using your willpower is not going to solve the problem either, because those thoughts stems from the subconscious mind, that represents 95% of our brain.

You may be saying that it’s impossible to dispel those nagging voices, but that’s the problem of what most people do.

Instead of doing that, I’m going to share 3 powerful strategies that I do every single day to cope with negative self-talk, to always have a sense of control of my life.

**1.Practice positive affirmations**

Positive affirmations is one the easiest way to disturb the negative voices in your head.

Words have a lot power to affect the energy level of the material world.

When you say them with emotional intensity, using your body, all you’re doing is disruption the old belief system that you’ve brought up with.

But if you want this technique to work, you need to show consistency, and persistence.

You can’t you disrupt your entire belief system in 1 week or two. Good things take time. Have faith, and have believe, you’ll notice a change on your attitude, your behaviors, and the way how you interact with others.

If you’re running out of what to say, you can access bellow to a list of 100 positive affirmations:

**2.Cutlivate a positive thinking**

One of the ways to cope with negative self-talk, is to nurture a positive view of the world around you.

The biggest mistakes that most of us do, is we try to eliminate a bad habit for example, but we don’t plan to replace with a good habit, and this is why most of us fail at coping with negative things.

Our mind dislike emptiness. The key to apply what I call the add-on principle.

The trick is to bombard your mind with activities that will bring you positivity in your life like reading, instructional books, doing the self-development, and slowly you’ll notice your inner voice start to change.

**3. Change your social environment**

Look, you can’t live a positive life, and hanging out, or being around with negative people. It doesn’t go together.

Most people are blaming how life sucks, how the government sucks, throwing all excuses around, contaminating other people, and if you still close to them, you will be contaminated too.

And what does, they start conforming that all the negative thoughts are real, so they start becoming bigger, crippling you from living the kind of life you want to live.",excited,Happiness

Thelma Schoonmaker, at 80, received her eighth Academy Award nomination for “Best Film Editing,” this time for “The Irishman,” yet another of the Martin Scorsese films she has edited. She's edited all of his films since “Raging Bull” in 1967, for which she received not just a nomination, but an Oscar itself. Her first. She’s totaled three so far. 

Thelma relishes the opportunity her work affords her to help shape the final product, to give the movie the “rhythm and pace” that contribute significantly to the overall impact on audiences.

"Positivity💗 Hi guys!! Life is so amazing, never underestimate it. When you feel like giving up, always remember what is to come!! And remember things don’t have to be bad. There’s always things to do even if you can’t figure them out. Walk, work out, draw, sing, play a sport, listen to music, talk to your friends, watch videos, and a lot more. Also set plans for yourself! I just made a set of goals for myself and organized them. I wanna change my style more so I just looked well and bought stuff I want. I wanna start working out so I found a list  online and decided to do that. I also wanna eat healthy but give myself a break and eat something unhealthy on Fridays. Remember if something you try doesn’t work, you can always try harder! There’s so much more to life than giving up and in the end you’ll wish you did the healthy things you wanted. You wouldn’t wanna lay in your death bed wondering why you were so scared of doing this one thing you wanted and regret it. Face your fears. Motivation is sooooo important and I know sometimes it’s hard to get but just think of the good that’ll come out of it!! Plan your future out a bit, make lists. Think of what you wanna do, what you wanna improve, and your dreams. There’s bad moments but the good moments make it worth it. You can have sooooo much coming for you everything just takes some work. You can do this!! Just keep going, stay strong, keep organized, and know what you want 💕",excited,Happiness

Some stories will change the course of our life forever.

Mine happened exactly 14 years ago today.

On the 25th of February 2006 a very young me decided her time in London had come to an end.

Fresh of a mini break in Italy where I felt the unceasing love of my dear ones, suddenly life here felt heavy and “stuck”.

I could picture myself being much older and still sharing a flat with people who’d never do their washing up quick enough for my liking.

I knew my best friends would soon move elsewhere or back to their countries, and it would have just been me left behind, missing the good old days.

Besides, having worked in retail all of my life, I could not see a way to get a better paid job which would make me feel more of an adult and less of an eternal teenager!

I felt stuck.

And I didn’t like that word.

I never did.

But if I can be really really honest to you, there was another reason.

After so many years spent looking for *“The One”*, the idea of still dating in my later years just terrified me.

I had been playing the *“game of love”* for so long, I just didn’t trust it could ever become something else.

I’d meet guys, and they’d seem “*OK-ish”* but never enough to make me hope the’d stay.

Or they’d be phoning in the middle of the night, promising eternal love while calling me someone else’s name!

It was clear that I was not good at this very unfunny dating game.

It was the same old story, while I wanted to write a new one.

#### My story.

And it just wasn’t happening.

And so all those years ago, one sunny 24th of February I spent the morning by myself to reflect on my decision to leave.

Walking around a very busy Borough Market, I hoped to find cakes that would heal the wound.

Life felt different that day.

Being among all those tourists and food lovers, made feel somehow alienated and detached.

I chose a couple of very inviting sweets and started to walk back home.

The river was very still and its bed golden under the sun’s rays.

“Oh, my beloved London, I shall miss you so” – I remember thinking while scoffing my cakes.

And then the most remarkable and extraordinary thing happened: I stood right in the middle of the road for what felt like an eternity.

In that moment something greater than myself overtook me and with much conviction and presence, I muttered to myself:

>***“God if you want me to be on my own for the rest of my life, I will.***  
***If you want me to leave London, I will.***  
***Your way, not mine”.***

I had never been so certain in my life, so present and so unafraid.

My body was engulfed in an exquisite blanket of self love and respect and I never wanted it to take it off.

For the first time in my life I had been able to surrender to whatever the moment in front of me was offering.

I felt at peace and complete.

Most of all, I felt a love that I had not experienced before.

A love, I knew there and then, that had come to stay and never leave,

I was ready for whatever was next, no matter where that would lead me to.

Little I knew that less than 10 hours later, I would meet my future husband in very improbable circumstances.

But this is a story for another time, and which I love sharing with others.

#### Today it’s all about the story that we start writing when we surrender to what it is.

When we trust the Universe to unload us from our worries and tribulations, we allow magic to happen.

The same magic that we’ve been trying to evoke by ourselves but which cannot stem from the burden we carry around.

We must share that load and allow something bigger than us to guide us while mending our wounds.

I can’t really say that I’m an expert at ***surrendering.***

I probably do better than most, yet the uneasiness is often still there.

In time I have learnt to accept that it’s part of our humanness.

Challenge after challenge, we learn to let go a bit more.

And hold on a bit less.

That’s when we know our spirit is growing: when we can look up the sky and say, over and over again, “Your way. Not Mine”.

And if you think that’s giving in to a cumbersome life, then think of the times you have been struggling against it!

When we learn to dance with life rather than put up a fight, we graciously start gliding through it.

As we lightly move in and out of our days, suddenly we start living more and worry less.

Ruth Heidrich, at 83, who set an astonishing record by becoming, at 48, the first vegan to complete an Ironman Triathlon, is still running marathons, placed gold in the U.S. Senior Olympics and has been named “One of the Ten Fittest Women in North America.” All this would be super, but now place it against how she began her triathlete journey. Diagnosed with Stage 4 Breast Cancer at 46, she was wowed by the curing possibilities of a vegan diet, and not only beat the cancer with this untraditional method, but got so strong she progressed from running marathons (which she already did), to Ironman Triathlons, and to this day, is still running. Her philosophy on life is simply – be grateful! That gratitude leads to hope, and hope leads to happy healthy lives. Indeed!",excited,Happiness

"Does anybody feel being kinder to those who are mean to you actually work? I feel if I can make a joke or make light of any situation it helps me be more happy. To me there's nothing worse than always having a negative reaction to everything.  I feel more in control of myself when I'm able to laugh and not take stuff so serious. 

If someone says ""you're fat"" your natural reaction is to say ""f-you"" back but if you turn  it into a joke and say ""well I have been eating a lot of cheeseburgers"" it really puts you in control. People crumble when you don't give them the reaction they want and that's just how I like it.",excited,Happiness
"I want to become a better person. Cameron Boyce, a Disney star that has made my and many others' childhoods unforgettable, has recently died at the age of 20. It's so heartbreaking, knowing how loved and appreciated he was by everyone in his life. His family and friends actively showed their love for him, and I can't blame them. He was loving, caring, intelligent, wise, and insanely talented. This also makes me happy knowing that his loved ones can live on with little to no regrets regarding him.

This made me realize how much I am NOT that person. I don't feel loved by my emotionally-distant family because my relationship with them doesn't allow me to be myself around them. I have little to no friends because I don't care enough to form connections with other people. I just feel like I'm a terrible person: I'm selfish, moody, lazy, and a huge loner. I spend day and night on the Internet, doing nothing with my life.

I want to be happy, loved, and energetic. I want to be full of life, and I want to deeply care for the people in my life and make THEM feel loved. I want to leave behind me a person that people will remember. Cameron was an incredible person, and because of that, I want to become a better person for myself others.

"Garbage So, as the title says, this post is about garbage, and how it brings me the simplest of joys. I never knew my marriage was built on Sand until I was no longer married. Looking back, I could no longer live in a home where it felt like there was only ever stress, power struggles, worries about the small things, dismissal of the bigger ones, disrespect, and bickering. When the dust settled from the subsequent avalanche, I found myself living in a family dynamic not much different than the one I had when married. I was in the same house, with the same kids... The only difference was that my brother now lived with us, rather than my husband.   
  
The rest of the differences were not visible to the eye, but they were profound. My kids were emotionally shattered by the mess my husband and I put them in the middle of, and it was obvious in their personalities that they had been forever scarre, but something interesting happened also. They had learned what true loss was. This made them, and myself, grateful for so many things we once took for granted.   
  
They noticed the things that were better. Unlike the disrespectful demands that they do this, or do that, they were met with simple requests and thank-yous. They did things without resistance or annoyance, and often on their own free will, without even having been asked. I picked up their plates from the table sometimes, and they would cook for me sometimes. My brother loved being there too. He was finally in a peaceful home, where everyone was just grateful to be in together.   
  
Now, don't get me wrong, the home we had previously, was full of love and laughter too, but it had come to have such an underlying tension, over time, that it was nearly palpable. This new home had plenty of welcome guests, laughter, love, and not a whole lot of money, but *tons* of peace and warmth. It felt *safe,* but I thought to myself, perhaps this will decay quickly, after the relief wears off, so I should keep my expectations low, which I did. I chose to also keep my hopes high, and made a promise to myself to bring only my best effort, everyday, to keep this home a safe serene place that people love to be.   
  
I noticed so many changes. We all did. Some of them were sad, after all, we all wished, deeply, that their stepdad was still here to share it with us. We missed him dearly, but we also knew that it couldn't be the same treasure if he hadn't left here in the first place. Some of the differences were pleasant, though, many of them, in fact. My gratitude was at an all time high, and i was super sensitized to positivity by now, as it had been so lacking in my life.   
  
Garbage.   
  
Yes. Garbage is one of the simplest things I noticed. It had always been heaping over the top of the can. Full bags and pizza boxes always resting next to the overflowing can. Ex husband always complaining about how no one ever took it out. It had always been an issue. I loved that without any prompting, or finger pointing, or even a word about it from anyone, the garbage can was suddenly *always* emptied and clean. I watched out of curiosity- surely it had to be myself and my brother who emptied it.... But it wasn't. It was *every single person in that house!*   
  
3/4 of a year have now passed.... Never once had that can overflowed. Never once has there been a bag unmoved resting next to it. And *never once* has there been any complaints. Still so much laughter, love, and *respect* for one another as there was on the very first day. My garbage can brings me the sweetest of joys in this world, because to me it represents a symphony of family love, the *only* way it should ever be.",excited,Happiness

"Smile or Die: How Positive Thinking Fooled America and the World - Barbara Ehrenreich ""This brilliant new book from the author of Nickel and Dimed and Bait and Switch explores the tyranny of positive thinking, and offers a history of how it came to be the dominant mode in the USA. Ehrenreich conceived of the book when she became ill with breast cancer, and found herself surrounded by pink ribbons and bunny rabbits and platitudes. She balked at the way her anger and sadness about having the disease were seen as unhealthy and dangerous by health professionals and other sufferers. In her droll and incisive analysis of the cult of cheerfulness, Ehrenreich also ranges across contemporary religion, business and the economy, arguing, for example, that undue optimism and a fear of giving bad news sowed the seeds for the current banking crisis. She argues passionately that the insistence on being cheerful actually leads to a lonely focus inwards, a blaming of oneself for any misfortunes, and thus to political apathy. Rigorous, insightful and bracing as always, and also incredibly funny, ""Happy Face"" uncovers the dark side of the 'have a nice day' nation.""

":Life is your own: :Feel Confident in vulnerability:

:Life is your own:

:Strive For happiness in the microscopic 
moment that is yours in the universe: 


When you are born, in that beautiful  moment,The world welcomes the only you to ever grace the face of the Earth. You are unique, you are amazing and you can be whomever your like.        

It is important to  focus on that precious moment. Because in that time,  the only care of anyone in the room is that you are healthy. Your umbilical cord is cut, your mothers fluids are cleaned and you become YOU! Its amazing that even in that moment you are more you, more unique, more yourself than the world would want you to be.    

The moments following and everything that takes place beyond that is shaped by what the world thinks you should be, who the world wants you to be. The decisions you make, the attitude you have and who you are. The world and its current inhabitants start choosing you and teaching you who to be. 

Now as an infant you must rely on your parents, Dr's and friends to aid you through those trying and learning years. 

The Challange is taking the teachings and using them to  there extent but not any further.
Sure you need to walk, talk and learn to eat. These are necessities. But through the years you are taught the habits, actions and personality of those around you. We become not who we are but who is around us. We continue to take the same ""need"" to learn we used with walking and talking. For who we are as people.   

This is a problem, because we are individuals until we see that society scoffs at the idea. No one wants to be the only one. And this is a learned concept. Because inevitably we are individuals, but life tells us thats scary in some way. Being alone is taught to be a bad thing. So we cling to others, we cling to the ""norm"" and we feel a need to fit in. Rather than being  the special and perfect you that you are! The beautiful baby you were in those 1st moments we should embrace but feel like we cant due to society's need to keep the collective. ",excited,Happiness

"Happiness can be taught Wall of text to follow, be warned! I have recently been working on a project that aims to assist the reader in the pursuit of the perfect version of themselves. There is no perfect version of anybody, but the never ending pursuit of perfection is key to consistently becoming a more well rounded person. 

You are in total independent control of your own happiness. True happiness is created and maintained according to the ability to control your perspective to avoid fixating on the aspects of your life that you are unsatisfied with, usually beginning with envy of the things that someone else has. If someone spends most their time lusting after things they don’t have, they stop considering the things that others envy of them. To be happy, one must simply focus on remaining constantly grateful and appreciative for all your loved ones and good fortune that currently enrich and define your life. We are all guilty of envious behaviors to varying extents from time to time, but the path to real happiness requires us to cease this behavior whenever possible. For example, John drives a secondhand economy sedan that’s condition could only be described as average if the person rating it had never seen an automobile before, and was also as blind as a bat born without eyes. John looks to his left and sees a spotless foreign sports car that couldn’t be more than a few months old. He thinks to himself, “I would be so happy every day if that was my car.”. Little does John know that there is a woman next to him on a bicycle who is thinking the exact thing about his trusty economy car. Simultaneously, a teenager on the sidewalk wearing worn down sneakers observes the woman and her bicycle, “I could get around the city three times faster if I had a bike like that!”. Unbeknownst to the teenager, someone was envious of his mode of transportation, walking. From the same third story window he sits at every afternoon, Michael looks down at the teenager on the street with a beat up pair of shoes from his wheelchair. “I wish I could walk like he can. I would spend all day just wandering through the alleys and parks, stopping at any random restaurant that I tracked down by smell, and not just ones that are able to give special assistance to the disabled.”. It may seem that the sports car driver is the only person truly happy here, but in his mind he is lusting after the racetrack specified limited edition version of his car. Now you’re probably getting a grasp on what kind of phenomenon is happening here. If everyone was grateful for what they had, especially considering there is always someone less fortunate than you are, each person would have been happy. It’s been said that the only reason to ever look in your neighbors bowl is to see if they have enough, not to see if they have more than you or vice-versa. When you base your happiness upon things like ego, materialism, and social status you will not allow yourself to be happy until you reach a “destination” such as a larger home, newer car, or “better” social circles, you have wrongfully convinced yourself of how to obtain happiness. Since you believe this is where all the joy is at, and you aren’t there yet, then you can’t possibly be happy until then. Unfortunately, there is a chance that you won’t ever reach the destination you set forth as the “beginning” of your happiness, and therefore deny yourself an entire lifetime of joy and delight for no reason at all, solely because a slight attitude change needed to occur and did not. We’ve all met people that are in a similar situation, they’re the jaded and cheerless individuals that are so convinced that their opportunity to be happy has long since taken flight, that they make no attempts to influence a future full of satisfying moments and deep contentment they can still have. That’s a future that no one wants to end up a part of, but what if you do reach that haven, though? Owning a big house, exotic cars, shiny doodads, and wealthy friends could make anybody smile! Say, after years and years of cheerless struggling you finally make it to your utopian promised land of bliss totally stocked with cool cars, fancy toys, and of course, a house that is uncomfortably large for four people, let alone just you. You sit in the quiet solitude offered by the fruit of your thousands upon thousands of woeful hours toiled, dwarfed by grand ceilings, waiting to be overcome with an unbelievable level of elation you have built up in your mind for ages. Except nothing happens, after all the years that quickly turned to hundreds of relinquished opportunities spent in favor of staying at home alone working late, passing on this potential romance, then blowing off that social event in a misguided attempt to leverage the totality of a decade’s worth of your life into the picture-perfect fantasy that you were sold. You are just as alone now as you were when you chose to stay home while your slowly losing touch friends went out to have experiences, make new connections, and cherish the friendship they have in each other. Your friends are not well-off financially, but they are far wealthier than you when it comes to happiness. While you were building an overpriced empty shell of an existence, they built families, had children, and spent time with each other. Happiness is an ability you develop by fighting off envy, ego, and materialism and acknowledging your gratitude for anything that causes you to be thankful.",excited,Happiness
"Slowly but surely loving myself After so many years of self hate and denial I am finally learning to cop with the truth and what seems to be life , you see all my life I felt like I always had to impress others and had the mindset that I was always supposed to be ( try ) to be better then everyone  , I would on purpose creat lies and lies to make myself feel better even as a kid. I would always feel the necessity to lie , even when things where good I would still lie to make them feel a bit what do you say... interesting. I would always be very denial , have such crazy imagination of how things should be and would be , always made everything in my mind seem so easy. As I got older those tendencies got a lot worse , I began to over do them quite very often , to the point I was loosing myself in my own lies and imaginary thoughts , creating this so called perfect world in my head , it wasn't easy either growing up with out a father nor a man figure to guide me in to the what do you say ? Right steps. So I never truly got to experience that , nor a bunch of things. I never learned how to express myself never learned how to express how I felt due to being afraid of rejection and abandonment , always in fear of people discovering how weak I was in the inside , I was truly becoming a lost soul for a very long time I had lost sense of what reality was , stuck in lies , stuck with the very negative and poisonous way of thinking followed with the same kind of thoughts , I'm now 20 years old and even tho I still have a very lot to love and experience I'm very happy I am finally realizing this such tragic situation I was stuck on for the majority of my 20 year life , I hope everyone sees it one day and find themselves like I'm focusing on and trying to do , it takes a lot to get the point to where I am but am I to say I'm 20 there's people of out there who are twice my age who have gone through so much worse and are still trying to cope , depression is a real bitch if I may say.. it's what's stops he from doing such many great things.. it's like a brick holding you down as you sink in a deep pool trying to swim up and gasp for air , I hope I keep this up , I was in a very deep whole only reason why I never gave in to self harm was do to it being in the Bible and it being a very serious sin to commit, I'm not very quite religious but that I do believe , that was never the answer , just had to deal with it step by step 1 day at a time , there's this thing I read on here that said something like "" One bad day doesn't mean a bad life "" hope everyone find happiness and joy remember no one forces you to do anything in life there is no right way of doing things there is no right path but your path.

"Finding happiness...By doing the laundry? Yep! Laundry- Finding order amidst the chaos of everyday life

I’ll definitely be the first to admit that household chores are not my favourite thing to do when I have a spare moment around my place. However, they are unfortunately one of life’s necessities. When I was in University, I used to leave dishes in the sink until my roommates began to claim that I had to be running some kind of gross science experiment. Laundry, however, can be one of those around-the-house tasks that you can at least can tolerate, if not actually enjoy.

For a large portion of my youth, my mother was the primary earner in the house, working a full-time Mon-Fri job, while my father was the secondary, working as a substitute teacher during the school year. What this meant was that my dad handled a lot of the day-to-day housework and took care of the kids for the majority of the day. He used to call himself ‘Mr. Mom’ a lot of the time, and still brags about it, even now. Short answer here is that I did not grow up seeing just one parent do most of the chores, it was well-broken down. Also, because my dad never stopped talking about his contributions, it meant that I never had any notions about a mystical ‘laundry-fairy’. I knew exactly where it came from and of course he had sure that as soon as I could walk that I knew how to do it.

Let’s talk about laundry then, the ultimate in transforming chaos into order. You take a massive pile of wrinkled and dirty clothes, place them in a magical device called a washing machine, they come out clean on the other end, and then they are folded and put away. I have learned by being around several people in my life, that everyone has their own unique style when it comes to doing the laundry. My aunt used to still hang clothes on the line outside to dry eventhough she had a dryer, saying she liked the fresh scent that only airing them outside could give.

Laundry is also one of the few chores that actually has a name associated with it in some people’s houses or buildings. It’s not the basement; it’s the laundry room…shudders. It’s borderline psychological warfare as far as I’m concerned. I am willing to wager that people would spend a lot less time in the living room if it was called the vacuum space.

The other thing I found about laundry when I was younger is how much fun a newly dried pile of clothes on a bed can be. It’s like a warm pile of leaves to a kid, and can easily be constructed into a fort (to your parents’ dismay sometimes when they’ve asked you to sort it and come back finding you trying to rescue the pillows from the evil sock empire). When I used to play hide and seek with my friends, if I was lucky there would be a fresh pile of laundry still waiting to be sorted on my parents’ bed, and if there was…well then I had the ultimate hiding spot. I will certainly admit to still jumping in the laundry pile on my bed now, to feel like a kid all over again, even if just for a moment.

Laundry, luckily, is one of the easier of the daily chores. It’s a matter of loading the machine, maybe scrubbing a spot or two with cleaner, and then closing the lid and waiting for it to do whatever it needs to do to make your clothes, sheets, and towels clean again. For those who don’t have their own machines, or live in an apartment (or college residence), then maybe you have a moment in the communal laundromat where you can sit cross-legged on your machine and read the latest book (or watch Netflix on your phone, no judgment here). You’re almost forced to take time for yourself, and that can sometimes be a beautiful thing…and much needed.

Then of course there’s the folding (if you don’t fold, no worries there, but give it a try sometime), of taking a pile of disorder and turning it into something neat, clean and organized. There’s no correct way of doing it either as I have discovered through many years that people have all been taught different ways of folding. Some roll, some cross-fold, some iron, and some flatten. Despite what your significant other may say, there’s no wrong way. Defend your battle strategy in the war on chaos!

So the next time you travel to the basement…or the laundromat, and toss that way-too-heavy dirty pile of clothes into the machine, take a moment for yourself and realize what you’re doing. You may not shower today, but at least your clothes will be clean for when you get around to putting them on. In the saga of daily life, it’s one thing that you at least have near-complete control over. You folded your shirts that way…or didn’t fold, either way, you won another battle, so be proud of your accomplishment. Now go outside and get them dirty again! Each spot is a badge of honour and memory in the fields of life.",excited,Happiness
